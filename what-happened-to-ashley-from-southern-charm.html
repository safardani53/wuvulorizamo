What is she up to now?</h2><p>After her time starring on Southern Charm and living in Charleston, S.C., Ashley moved back to her native California in February 2019. "Thanks for the life lessons South Carolina but I'm goin' back to my roots!" she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Instagram</a> at the time. "#CaliforniaGirl."</p><p>The following January, Ashley told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> she didn’t "see the light at the end of the tunnel" amid her breakup with Thomas, whom she dated from 2017 to 2018. "I didn't know how I was going to get out of it and be honest with you, it just kept stacking up higher and higher to where I just felt like it's almost impossible. You know, like, 'I'm never going to get out of this,'" she added, pointing to her weight loss as a symptom of her stress.</p><p>She went on: "I remember feeling at times just hopeless, you know, and just disappointed and ashamed of things I did and the way that it was portrayed to millions, really. It's one thing if it's on you, your family, and your friends, but, like, for everyone else to see it…"</p><p>Though Ashley briefly appeared on the Season 6 finale by attempting to crash a party hosted by Patricia Altschul, she's since put her reality TV days behind her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ashley Jacobs Appel (@ashleyhjacobs)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ashley Jacobs wed Mike Appel in 2021 — and the two now share a son together!</h2><p>Following Thomas and Ashley's split in 2018, Thomas went on to have a son named Jonathan Jackson Ravenel with his ex, Heather Mascoe.</p><p>Ashley also moved on. She went public with Mike Appel, the co-founder of designer underwear brand Related Garments, in December 2019. The two actually began dating in August of that year.</p><p>"I'm so happy," she told Us Weekly a month later, in early 2020. "It's weird having something so healthy. It feels too good to be true, but I think that's how most things are to be honest with you."</p><p>The couple got engaged just a few months later.</p><p>Ashley announced that she was expecting her first child with Mike in June 2021, and she also shared that the two had actually already tied the knot shortly before.
