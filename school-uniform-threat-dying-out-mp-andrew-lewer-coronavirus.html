larger class sizes in September.</p><p>MPs have warned that the traditional school uniform is in danger of “dying out”.</p><p><strong>⚠️ Read our <a href=#>coronavirus live blog</a> for the latest news & updates</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000527195416-1.jpg><p>Following Department for Education (DfE) guidance which recommends that students and staff come to school each day in fully-clean clothes, a school near Bradford has already scrapped the wearing of blazers, shirts and ties from September.</p><p>Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said the <a href=#>Government wants all schoolkids back in the classroom for the new school year</a> in September.</p><p>The chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Independent Education, Conservative MP Andrew Lewer, said school uniform was at risk of “dying out altogether”.</p><p>He told <a href=# aria-label="The Daily Telegraph (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">The Daily Telegraph</a>: “Covid-19 has already gravely disrupted the schooling of children right across the country.</p><p>“The last thing we want to see is it now striking at one of the great traditions of British schools, distinctive uniforms worn with pride by pupils at 90 per cent of our schools.</p><p>“As health experts such as Professor Linda Bauld have pointed out, the coronavirus risk from a school blazer or tie is minimal.</p><p>“Unlike hospitals, where staff have to change and wash their clothes every day, schools are places where the risk of transmission is extremely low.”</p><p>Traditional school uniforms, where a school badge is worn on a blazer or jacket with distinctive colours or patterns, are also under threat from a Private Member’s Bill which is currently going through Parliament.</p><p>It calls for school uniforms to only include unbranded items.</p><p>Mr Lewer added: “The pretext for cutting back on branded items is cost, but I dispute the claims made that parents would save money if schools switched to unbranded generic items, like plain white shirts and grey trousers and skirts bought in local supermarkets.</p><p>“In any case, there is plenty that is done, or can be done, to help families on lower incomes.</p><p>“The Government gave reassurances in the original debate on this change to the law that should prevent it becoming a back-door route to phasing out uniforms.</p><p>"It would be a great shame if a combination of unfounded fears over the virus and a proposed well-meaning change in the law were to consign yet another of our traditions to the scrapheap.”</p><p>Earlier this week, the headteacher of Beckfoot Oakbank School in Keighley, West Yorkshire, said that its 1,500 pupils would not be required to wear blazers, ties and shirts at the start of the next academic year.</p><p>Tina Smith said unbranded polo t-shirts and jumpers could be worn instead, partly due to <a href=#>coronavirus</a> and partly to “keep costs down”.</p><p>In a letter to parents, she wrote: "DfE guidance (which we have followed throughout) states that blazers and ties are not encouraged as it is recommended that students and staff come to school each day in full clean clothes in the interest of safety for all.</p><p>"Washing a blazer or a tie, or even washing and ironing a clean shirt daily is not realistic."</p><p>It is thought around 90 per cent of state schools require pupils to wear some sort of uniform.</p><p>A Children’s Society survey five years ago claimed the average annual cost of school uniform at secondary level was £350, although this figure included items such as a bag and sports kit, which wouldn’t necessarily have to be purchased every year.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>Another survey carried out by the Schoolwear Association, which represents manufacturers, claimed the figure was closer to £100 a year.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>At the end of May <a href=#>pupils were told to leave their ties, blazers and bags at home</a> and parents warned not to "natter" at the gates as schools started to open up as the coronavirus threat began to ease.</p><p>A few schools even advised pupils to wear their PE kit every day instead of their normal uniform so they wouldn’t need to use changing rooms after sporting activities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
