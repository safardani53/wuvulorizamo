porn blasts from a giant screen before cutting to, bizarrely, a nature documentary featuring late ­Aussie crocodile hunter Steve Irwin.</p><p>I feel like Alice In Bonking-land as I take in the unfolding debauchery.</p><p>Welcome to Stoketoberfest, an ­unofficial and very naughty offshoot of Munich’s famous <a href=#>Oktoberfest</a>, which makes the annual booze marathon look like a children’s tea party.</p><p>This secret festival, where revellers heartily embrace the instruction to “leave their inhibitions at the door”, has proved a hit with Brits who are flocking to Bavaria’s capital for the three-week Oktoberfest, which ends in six days’ time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436345900.jpg><p>Mancunian visitor Dan, 27, tells me: “I arrived last night and have already slept with five girls.</p><p>“I was meant to go to <a href=#>Oktoberfest</a>, but what’s the point when it’s far more fun here?”</p><p>I had come to Munich to investigate Oktoberfest after hearing that locals were upset with the low-cut Bavarian “barmaid” outfits favoured by female British ­revellers.</p><p>They made the ­traditional costume — known as a dirndl — look like a “porno dress”, com­plain­­ed 70-year-old resident Franz ­Thalhammer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Oktoberfest hall, my frock was mocked for not being “busty enough”.</p><p>Munich local Lina, 30, tells me: “We do cars and bras ­better”, as she insists I swap my UK fancy dress for an authentic 200 euro (£178) dirndl, an outfit ­featuring what she describes as “the German version of a Wonderbra”.</p><p>The bra packs more punch than boxing champ Anthony Joshua and I feel like a knockout as the super-tight material boosts me from a modest C cup to a voluptuous E.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

down steins, equivalent to two pints of ale.</p><p>If you fail, the crowd boos and lobs pretzels at you.</p><p>Nearby, a twentysomething brunette is cutting up some suspicious-looking white powder with her British driving licence, then snorting the lines.</p><p>But if I thought today could not get any more debaucherous I was wrong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436345897.jpg><p>“This isn’t the real party,” whispers Matt, 26, a salesman from Nottingham. “This is just the warm up.”</p><p>That’s how I find myself on the short drive to Stoketoberfest, where skimpy outfits are the least of anyone’s concerns.</p><p>Matt had warned me I needed to “see it to believe it”. He was right.</p><p>At the Wheel Of Misfortune, drinkers are playing a wild game of dares, with the giant roulette wheel choosing forfeits such as swapping clothes, throwing your undies into a tree, running naked and doing a shoey (drinking a stein from your shoe).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436346228.jpg><p>Right now, a 26-year-old guy called Ben from Leeds is spinning it. The arrow lands on “give us your undies” so he strips off and throws his ­boxers into the tree above — where hundreds of other pairs already hang.</p><p>“This place is wild,” Ben says, as he tries to put his clothes back on.</p><p>“I’ve never been to a party like this. I’m sharing a tent with a ­randomer but he wasn’t very happy when he returned and I was having sex with a girl in there.”</p><p>Ben disappears into the darkness and more festival-goers board the steps to take their turn at the wheel. Two girls land on “running naked” so they strip off and race scream­ing through the crowd.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436346207.jpg><p>Meanwhile, revellers dancing in front of the main stage are going wild as the DJ blasts out Renegade Master and people start throwing beer over each other.</p><p>Around the corner, there’s a long queue for the “super secret” party.</p><p>You need a special ticket to enter and it feels like a scene from the erotic Nineties film Eyes Wide Shut as you’re handed a masquerade mask on arrival.</p><p>Inside, a girl is guzzling beer through a long tube cheered on by revellers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436345898.jpg><p>Half-naked fire breathers are performing risqué tricks while naughty guests writhe on the ground. Naked mannequins loom in the corners of the room.</p><p>Nearby, young couples are piling into the “kissing booth”. It’s not just for kissing on the lips,” giggles one girl, as she drags a guy towards it.</p><p>She tells me her name is Amy and she is a 22-year-old film ­student from Kent. “I was meant to go to Oktoberfest but I didn’t make it,” she adds, ­laughing.</p><p>“We started drinking here at 8am and everyone is saying here is so much better than the actual event.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436346254.jpg><p>The guy she is snogging chips in: “It’s all beer, boobs, and bonking here — what’s not to love?”</p><p>It is easy to see why Brits are flocking to the alternative festival.</p><p>For just 60 euros (£53) a night you arrive to your pre-erected tent and for ten euros a day you get unlimited beer, sangria and food.</p><p>People start queuing for booze from 8am.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436345992.jpg><p>At Oktoberfest you’re looking at 12 euros a stein and at least £350 a night for a hotel room in Munich. The event is run by Stoke Travel, an alternative festival company based in Barcelona.</p><p>On site, there’s a fancy dress shop selling Bavarian outfits for just 70 euros. You’re also treated to live bands, glitter painting, a tattoo parlour, several bars and a shisha lounge.</p><p>Back to tonight, and by 3am it is raining hard.</p><p>But nothing is going to stop these frisky festival-goers from getting their kicks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436346000.jpg><p>More than 2,000 tents are rocking and, in free-love style, most tenants have left the canvas wide open.</p><p>“We didn’t quite make it to ­Oktoberfest,” giggles a pretty ­brunette, who’s sandwiched between two handsome guys — all three naked after having a threesome.</p><p>“We’ve only left the tent to top up on beer,” she continues, before turning and kissing the boys.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN WORLD NEWS</h2></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Inside Munich's adults-only Octoberfest party - with beer, boobs and bonking</span><p>Fearing they’ll ask me to join in any second, I scuttle off — and soon pass another couple getting steamy in the back seat of a car. They laugh as they see me walking past, seemingly enjoying an audience.</p><p>Terrified of what I’ll see next, I leave. The next morning, I wake in my peaceful hotel room and ponder if I dreamt the whole thing.</p><p>I wonder if the locals who moaned about saucy Oktoberfest outfits know what’s going on just down the road. For the sake of their blood pressure, I hope not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbIB5gI9uaWirpKS4psDOm5yrnpWowW651KegnKBdpLi1u8GeqZ%2Bdo6l6tLHXZqeaqqSufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ciara-amas-2020-dress-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shows Off Post-Baby Body In Sexy Red Gown Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joseph-parker.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Joseph Parker net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
