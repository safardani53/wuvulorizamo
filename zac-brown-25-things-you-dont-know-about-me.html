While supporting the <strong>Zac Brown Band</strong>’s new album, The Comeback, <a href=#><strong>Zac Brown</strong></a> himself exclusively revealed some fun facts about himself to Us Weekly.</p><p>Brown, 43, is the country group’s lead singer, but when he isn’t rocking out on stage,<a href=#> he’s at home</a> with his five kids — daughters Justice, 14, Lucy, 13, Georgia, 11, and Joni, 10, as well as son Alexander, 7. The musician coparents with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Shelly Brown</strong></a>, from whom he split in 2018. “I like teaching my kids how to do stuff,” the Georgia native told Us.</p><p>The proud papa revealed that he loves playing Fortnite and Monopoly with his family, and they like to spend Sundays on the water. When he isn’t with his kids, he’s <a href=#>in the studio</a>. While he loves a lot of his songs — he said “Colder Weather” will always be a special one — but a certain track from his new album, The Comeback, which dropped on October 15, is a new favorite.</p><p>“I really love ‘Stubborn Pride’ (feat. Marcus King), off our new album, The Comeback,” he said. “I love a lot of our new songs.”</p><p>Brown told Us all about his favorite things, hidden talents and more. Scroll down for 25 things you don’t know about the artist:</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>1. My favorite cheat meal is pizza.<br>2. My first job was at The Wagon Wheel, which was a catfish fry house. I cleaned the grease machines, pots and pans.<br>3. The best concerts I’ve ever played were probably in Boston. Every show at Fenway Park is epic. The Gorge Amphitheater in Washington State is also epic.<br>4. I have a lot of tattoos! I carry my art around with me. I love art and collect it as well.<br>5. My secret talent is I like to make knives — and then I like to cook with them.<br>6. I’m always trying to get better at guitar, which is a lifelong practice.<br>7. I have three dogs and a lot of chickens. I couldn’t imagine a life without dogs!<br>8. My favorite artist when I was growing up was <strong>James Taylor</strong>.<br>9. My favorite new artist is <strong>Tenille Townes</strong>.<br>10. My go-to truck stop snack food is Jack Link’s Beef Jerky.<br>11. My favorite item of clothing is a belt that I’ve had forever. It’s very sentimental to me. I love how it gets more worn-in over time.<br>12. My favorite cover song to play is usually the newest one that we have learned. Right now, I love covering Wood Brothers songs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zac-brown.jpg><p>13. I cook really good chili.<br>14. I love the show <a href=#>Ted Lasso</a>.<br>15. My life motto is, “You get what you give.”<br>16. My favorite actors are <a href=#><strong>Woody Harrelson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Daniel Day-Lewis</strong></a>,<strong> Danny McBride</strong> and Zac Brown. [McBride’s TV series] The Righteous Gemstones is the jam!<br>17. My favorite games to play are <a href=#>Fortnite</a> and Monopoly.<br>18. On any given Sunday afternoon, I’m likely on the water with my kids.<br>19. My two favorite places to vacation are Alaska and Hawaii.<br>20. I’m not sure how many total hats I have, but I probably have about eight or 10 that I swap around.<br>21.When I work out, I love my Arc Trainer. I can get on there and play Madden for an hour and be done. I also love hiking and being outdoors.<br>22. My favorite part of Georgia is up in the Appalachian Mountains, on a river.<br>23. I can’t leave home without my DemerBox! It charges my phone, keeps all my stuff together, floats and plays music for [over 40] hours without having to charge it. It’s the best speaker ever.<br>24. Before each show, we all huddle up, put our hands in and shout, “Oooh, girl!”<br>25. The best advice I’ve ever received is to be in gratitude. Wake up and picture the people and things that you are grateful for [before] starting your day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaLGam12Xv7DDzWZpbmWknbavs9JmsKitXZm8r8CMpKWor12Wr7DB02aknmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-deossie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Steve DeOssie net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-bet-david-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-lifestyle-and-career-highlights.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Bet-David Net Worth: How Rich Is He?
