Your kids are so lucky to have you ❤️."</p><p>Despite separating in 1998, the Hollywood stars have remained on good terms and have even been isolating together during the global coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The pair's eldest daughter, Rumer, also took to social media to post some epic throwbacks of her and her father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000590770388-e1592771098247.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000590770385-e1592771441976.png><p>The first showed a very young-looking Bruce cradling his eldest and laying in bed with her, and were captioned: "Happy Fathers Day Papa. I love you so much."</p><p>A second post showed the father and daughter duo pulling very serious faces as Rumer jokingly wrote alongside it: "I love you Daddio. I’m so glad we aren’t dramatic people..."</p><p>And a third series of pics showed Rumer as a young child in a variety of poses with her dad, including a couple where she and her sisters Scout and Tallulah had visited their dad on film sets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000590770344-e1592772494767.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000590770383-e1592771494724.png><p>"Happy Father’s Day Daddio. Thank you for always being a weirdo and making it ok for me to be one too.
