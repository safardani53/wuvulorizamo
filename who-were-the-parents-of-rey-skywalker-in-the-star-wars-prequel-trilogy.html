If you are, you are probably already acquainted with Rey Skywalker. The scavenger-turned-Jedi has captured the hearts of followers all across the globe with her strength, courage, and compassion. But what precisely do you know about Rey Skywalker? Where did she come from? Who are her parents? What will happen to her? Prepare for an exciting journey into the mysterious realm of Rey Skywalker, Star Wars enthusiast.</p><h2>Rey Skywalker Parents</h2><p><strong>Rey’s parents</strong>, Dathan and Miramar Skywalker were modest trash traders who resided on the desolate planet Jakku. Dathan, a clone of the infamous Sith Lord Darth Sidious, had a connection to the Force that he passed on to his daughter Rey. Their peaceful life was upended when Ochi of Bestoon, a Sith assassin hired by Sidious, set out to locate Rey.</p><p>Fearing for their family’s safety, Dathan and Miramir decided to leave Rey on Jakku to keep her safe. They reasoned that keeping the family together would only put their daughter in danger.&nbsp;Unfortunately, their intentions to return for Rey when circumstances improved were shattered when Ochi cruelly slaughtered them and continued his relentless search after discovering they didn’t know where Rey was. Rey’s parents perished suddenly, but she eventually found out what had happened to her family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rey-Skywalker-2.jpg alt="Rey Skywalker" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the third film trilogy, she found she was Darth Sidious’ granddaughter. But Rey refused to be defined by her family.&nbsp;Instead, she accepted her fate and aspired to join the ranks of the Jedi Knights, like her idols, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker. Her path became one of growth, resilience, and revolt against the constraints imposed by her ancestors.</p><h2>Rey Skywalker: Who Is She?</h2><p><strong>Rey Skywalker</strong> is the primary character of the Star Wars prequel trilogy.&nbsp;Because she was reared as a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku, she is strongly bonded to the Force.&nbsp;Despite being the granddaughter of the wicked Sith Lord Darth Sidious, Rey resolves to embrace the Skywalker family legacy and embarks on a mission to become a Jedi Knight.&nbsp;Rey’s parents, Dathan and Miramir, took the difficult path of leaving her on the planet after the Battle of Endor to protect her from the influence of her grandfather.</p><p>Growing up, Rey honed her scavenging skills, learning to live in a hazardous environment while using her mechanical and flying abilities. She had no clue Rey had such a strong affinity with the Force. Everything changed for Rey when she met Finn, Poe Dameron, and the droid BB-8 in 2015. She joined their ranks after being inspired by their cause and the Resistance’s struggle against the authoritarian First Order, swiftly establishing herself as an essential member.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rey-Skywalker-1.jpg alt="Rey Skywalker" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>With her unwavering commitment and increasing Force mastery, Rey played a vital part in the Resistance’s victories against the First Order, eventually reaching her potential as a Jedi Knight. When the narrative concluded, Rey consciously chose the Skywalker surname to commemorate her role models and friends, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.&nbsp;She started rebuilding the Jedi Order and endeavors to restore peace to the galaxy with this major gesture, carrying on the Skywalker name’s heritage.</p><h2>Is Rey Skywalker killed off in the end?</h2><p>There is no conclusive canonical evidence of Rey Skywalker’s death. As a result, her fate after the Skywalker saga remains unknown.</p><p>In the closing events of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Rey goes on a journey to resurrect the Jedi Order and bring peace to the galaxy. In a poignant moment, Rey visits the Lars homestead on Tatooine, where Luke and Leia are buried. She buries their lightsabers as she stares at the two suns, similar to Luke in the well-known scene from A New Hope.</p><p>As she prepares to go, the Force ghosts of Luke and Leia appear, indicating their presence and direction. When Rey discovers she is a part of their lineage, she adopts the Skywalker surname. Although some fans expect Rey’s demise, there is yet to be a definitive conclusion in the canon that has been written.&nbsp;Rey’s narrative concludes with her embarking on a new journey to uphold the Skywalker family’s values and continue the Jedi lineage.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddrLKzsYytn55loJa%2FprrTrGSonl2nsrp50qSwsJmcoLKzecinZK2glWLAta3RZq6aqqNivbOx0K6cpWWkp7atu8ayZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./annabelle-bond.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Annabelle Bond net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-wesley-schultz-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Wesley Schultz Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
