Following months of speculation on social media, the musician confirmed the news with an Instagram snap. RiRi’s hand clutching the NFL football was the lone image in the post.&nbsp;Seth Dudowsky, NFL Head of Music, published his own remark criticizing the performance shortly after. RiRi was described as a “once-in-a-generation artist” in the statement:</p><p>“We are pleased to have Rihanna perform at the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show.” Rihanna is a one-of-a-kind artist who has been a cultural force her whole career. We are excited to work with Rihanna, Roc Nation, and Apple Music to provide fans another historic Halftime Show performance.”</p><p>In an official release, Jay-Z, whose entertainment business Roc Nation will oversee RiRi’s performance, also broke the momentous news. In a brief reflection on the singer’s childhood, he stated:</p><p>“Rihanna is a generational talent, a lady from modest roots who has consistently outperformed expectations.” A person born on the little island of Barbados rose to prominence as one of the world’s most notable painters. “I am a self-made businessman and entertainer.”</p><p>The announcement of RiRi’s performance threw fans into a frenzy, with many going to social media to celebrate:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>i don’t think i’ve waited any more patiently for anything than for the return of RIHANNA. WE REJOICE.</p><p>— amorphous (@loneamorphous) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 25, 2022</a></p><p>The 2023 Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show will purportedly take place on February 12, 2023, outside of Phoenix, Arizona, during Super Bowl LVII. DPS with Roc Nation and Jesse Collins will produce the program and act as executive producers, while Hamish Hamilton will direct.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rihanna-1.jpg alt=Rihanna width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Twitter is buzzing about Rihanna’s forthcoming Super Bowl Halftime Show.</h2><p>The Super Bowl Halftime Show is widely regarded as one of the most important musical spectacles of all time and features some of the year’s most memorable musical performances. With the 2023 performance planned to take place in February, organizers just made a significant announcement by announcing RiRi as the event’s next headliner. Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats, also said that they were “eager” to cooperate with the We Found Love hitmaker:</p><p>“Rihanna is a phenomenal recording artist who is a favorite of many millions of Apple Music subscribers worldwide.” We’re thrilled to be working with Rihanna, Roc Nation, and the NFL to put on a historic spectacle for music and sports fans – what a great artist for the debut Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show.”</p><p>Because the pop singer has been absent from the music industry for some years, the news of the Super Bowl Halftime Show has piqued the interest of both fans and celebrities. Many people rushed to Twitter to express their feelings on the approaching major event:</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rihanna-2.jpg alt=Rihanna width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>According to the Hollywood Reporter, Apple Music will likely provide more information about the program in the coming months.&nbsp;RiRi released her previous album, Anti, over six years ago in 2016, and seems to have gone on pause after postponing the release date of her finished ninth studio album in 2019 indefinitely.&nbsp;Given this, it’s unclear if the musician’s performance in the Super Bowl will also involve the introduction of her long-awaited new album. Several music artists have previously utilized the major musical event to announce new albums and tours.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipoqCRo7uiecCnpaitnpiypXnHnqlmqJGnwaqvyKmYraGfo3qnu9Fmq6GdXWd9c3%2BMrKypnaJir7DDy2afmqSWqbausYysn6ivXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./street-brawl-sheffield-page-hall.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shocking moment mass brawl erupts in street with men and women hurling bricks, chairs and a wooden B</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michaela-mcareavey-family-how-many-siblings-does-she-have.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michaela Mcareavey Family: How Many Siblings Does She Have?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
