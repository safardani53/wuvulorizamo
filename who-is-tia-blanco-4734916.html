Well, you will! <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brody Jenner</strong>,</a> 39, has been dating professional surfer <strong>Tiarah Blanco</strong>, 26, for over a year now, and the year ahead is pretty busy for the pair! First, they announced that Tiarah, who goes by Tia, is pregnant and is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>expecting their first child</a> in 2023. Then, at the baby shower, Brody decided he wanted the surfer star to be his wife, so he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>popped the question</a> in front of all of their friends and family. Spoiler alert — she said yes!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The couple reportedly met in Hawaii when&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hills</a>&nbsp;star was on vacation, and they started dating in the middle of April. They were photographed together for the first time on May 12 picking food up from Erewhon Market in Calabasas, California. This is Brody’s first confirmed relationship since his&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>brief romance</a>&nbsp;with model&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Josie Canseco</strong></a>, 25, in 2019. He had split from his wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kaitlynn Carter</a>&nbsp;</strong>earlier that year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Like all of Brody’s exes, Tia is drop-dead gorgeous. She’s athletic as hell, too. Here’s everything you need to know about Tia Blanco.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tia-blanco-brody-jenner-dating-5-things-embed1.jpg><h2><span><span><i>1. She’s originally from Puerto Rico&nbsp;</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Tia was born on May 5, 1997 in Puerto Rico. She moved to Hawaii and then to San Clemente, California when she was young and pursued surfing in the states. Tia eventually honored her Puerto Rican roots by changing flags back in 2018 to represent her home country in surfing competitions. “I have always had a sense of connection with Puerto Rico and it has always been a part of my background/story,” she said in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an interview.</a> “PR is technically still a part of America and my dad served in the US military there, therefore, I still feel like I am representing both flags in a way.”</p><h2><span><span><i>2. She’s a successful pro surfer</i></span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tia-blanco-brody-jenner-dating-5-things-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Tia’s first big win in surfing was the first place gold medal at the 2015 International Surfing Association Open Women’s World Surfing Championship. She successfully defended her title the following year. Tia has revealed in past interviews that she learned how to surf at the age of 3 from her father when they were living in Hawaii.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Every contest and every surf trip has helped me tremendously to become the person and surfer I am today,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>The&nbsp;Clymb</i>.</a>&nbsp;“Each triumph and defeat were all crucial for me. After each loss I really dig deep to figure out exactly what went wrong and I always walk away having learned so much. I am still learning so much and I have so many more goals in surfing that I hope to&nbsp;accomplish,” Tia added.</p><h2><span><span><i>3. Yoga is her passion.</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tia actively does yoga in videos that she shares to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>YouTube</a>. She told&nbsp;The Clymb&nbsp;that she does yoga and meditates everyday to prepare for swim competitions. “I also see a trainer several times a week when I am at home who helps me on my technique and strength as it relates to my&nbsp;surfing,” she shared.</p><h2><span><span><i>4. She’s been on reality TV.</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tia competed on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Challenge: Champs vs. Pros</a>&nbsp;on MTV in 2017. The special mini-series featured ten alums from&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Challenge</a>&nbsp;competing against ten pro athletes for charity. Tia was eliminated in episode 4, but still managed to raise $1,000 for St. Jude’s Children Hospital. She also competed on the 2021 ABC surfing competition series,&nbsp;The Ultimate Surfer. Tia won the show alongside&nbsp;<strong>Zeke&nbsp;</strong><b>Lau</b>. Their reward was $100,000 and the opportunity to compete on the WSL Championship Tour.</p><h2><span><span><i>5. She’s vegan</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Tia became a vegan because of her mom, who is a vegetarian. She’s never eaten red meat and now her entire family is vegan as well. Tia has shared tips about her vegan diet on IG and YouTube.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LBqq2Mm6OappOkenWDkm1wam5f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./derrius-guice.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Derrius Guice net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jessica-fishenfeld-from-americas-got-talent.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Jessica Fishenfeld From Americas Got Talent?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
