I soon began selling little things of my own – but always for local charities.</p><p>“There was also a tip that we discovered, as kids, where people from decades back had just chucked things away – broken bits and pieces, old glass bottles for pop, things like that.</p><p>“To me, it was fascinating because everything told a story. I still love that aspect of the business, when I find something in, say, a house clearance or a valuation day, I always seem to look beyond any potential worth it may have, and I think to myself ‘Who owned this, who loved it, what is it telling me? What is the history here?’”</p><h2>What TV shows has Caroline been on?</h2><p>Due to her antique expertise, Caroline has been featured on a number of television shows as an expert.</p><p>Her on-camera CV includes stints on Flog It! and Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is, but she is best known for her time on <a href=#>Bargain Hunt as one of the professional experts</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><h2>Is Caroline married?</h2><p>Caroline is married to former footballer John Hawley and has been since 2008.</p><p>During his playing days, John featured for <a href=#>Arsenal</a>, <a href=#>Hull City</a>, Scunthorpe United and Bradford City.</p><p>While playing for Bradford, he was part of the rescue efforts during the Bradford City stadium fire disaster.&nbsp;</p><p>John has been credited with saving the life of a supporter after he pulled him to safety.</p><p>Together, the couple owns and run Hawleys Auctioneers, an auction shop located in North Cave and Beverley in East Yorkshire.</p><p>Before he was a footballer, John briefly worked in his father's antique shop in 1966.</p><h2>Does Caroline have any children?</h2><p>Caroline has two sons, James and Charles, from her previous marriage before John.</p><p>She has previously mentioned how, while pregnant with Charles, she actually went into labour while bidding at an auction.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Caroline said: "I was heavily pregnant with Charles at one auction, and in fact I went into labour as I was bidding for something or other.</p><p>"I managed to buy it before I was carted off to the maternity unit."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmR%2FeISRbm1qZ6edvG6vwKumpaGemnqprdalnLJlkpa%2FqK3Ip2ShrZ6pfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eliza-dushkus-husband-peter-palandjian-how-many-kids.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Eliza Dushku's husband?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./my-600-lb-life-preview-nathan-amber-season-9-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nathan &amp;amp; Amber Have Never Had Sex Video Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
