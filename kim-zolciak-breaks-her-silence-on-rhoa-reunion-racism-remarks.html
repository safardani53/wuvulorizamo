I sincerely apologize,” the Bravo personality, 39, said in a statement to Us Weekly on Thursday, April 26, via her publicist Jack Ketsoyan. “Edited out of context, I understand why my remark angered people. Racism is a sad reality in the United States. It has been prevalent throughout our country’s history. Let me be very clear, I do NOT support, tolerate or put up with any form of racism, hate or other discrimination. My love for ALL people runs deep — I am open to all and always have been.”</p><p>She continued, “I was heartbroken when I watched the last few minutes of the episode and saw how my words were taken out of context. My comment that seemingly ‘racism didn’t exist 10 years ago’ was made as part of a larger, emotional 45-minute conversation about how, sadly, social media has become a hub for hate. Immediately following my confusing comment, I also said that ‘it’s not as real as it is now,’ referring to the power of social media. But those remarks didn’t make the show.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kim-zolciak-apologizes.jpg><p>“I believe that social media has made a centuries-old issue more real,” Zolciak added. “Before social media, the public simply observed the news. Now, the public actively participates and has an opportunity to take action — in real time. But this is a double edged sword. Now, when false accusations are made, they are amplified by online platforms regardless of their merit. This wasn’t the case 10 years ago when I started on RHOA.”</p><p>She concluded, “I truly pray that the people wishing horrible things on others, and on me, channel that energy into something positive. Our world would be a much better place if you do. I am committed to making this world a better place to live. I will continue to learn from, and be open to, ALL people.”</p><p>As previously reported, the “Google Me” singer — who claimed earlier in the season that her RHOA costar <a href=#><strong>NeNe Leakes</strong></a> lives in a “roach nest” amid a headline-making social media feud — came under fire on social media after her remarks on Sunday’s reunion.</p><p>“This whole racism thing in this day and age is bulls–t,” she said on the explosive episode. “Everyone of those motherf–kers on that couch owe this world a f–king apology for this racism s–t. They already tried to claim that s–t long ago. Nobody bought into it then because the social media wasn’t there and racism wasn’t f–king all that real. You know it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the end of the reunion, Zolciak called host <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> into the bathroom to express her frustration over the way she was treated by him and her castmates. She told the executive producer, 49, that “there wasn’t even one positive question” for her, to which he responded, “There was nothing positive, unfortunately, in your story from the season. It was all combative.”</p><p>Us exclusively revealed on Wednesday, April 25, that the reality star — who <a href=#>will not return</a> for season 11 of RHOA — has <a href=#>halted production</a> on her spinoff, <a href=#>Don’t Be Tardy</a>, in the wake of the scandal. “Kim has pulled the plug on filming,” a source told Us. “She’s very upset about the entire situation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1ix7C4wqKYpGWSp7Kit9Jmn56qXai2rbHNnJxmp55iv6m7wGapnq2enryvedGamqKrnWK%2FprnAq6KsZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./veteran-meteorologist-tom-skilling-announces-retirement-after-45-years-8357526.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Veteran Meteorologist Tom Skilling Announces Retirement After 45 Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./laina-g-king-kaiser-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Many Kids Do Laina G and King Kaiser Have?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
