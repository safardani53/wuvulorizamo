Still, Jeremiah used his Instagram to share his life through photos. On the drummer’s account, fans can see pictures of nature, animals, and his family, including his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Green</a>.</p><p>In December 2022, Jeremiah made headlines for something other than his band and his wife.

At 45, Jeremiah had been privately dealing with his stage 4 cancer diagnosis.</p><p>“Please send healing vibes for my son, Jeremiah Green, who is battling stage 4 cancer,” Carol wrote above several pictures of Jeremiah. “He’s is so strong and so brave and hanging in there!”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Carol received many comments from fans offering their prayers and support to Jeremiah, Lauren, and their young son Wilder.

I’d like to say a bunch of pretty words right now, but it just isn’t the time. These will come later and from many people. Please appreciate all the love you give, get, have given, and will get. Above all, Jeremiah was about love. We love you."</p><p>Jeremiah’s mom also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a statement</a> confirming her son’s death. She stated that his cause of death was related to his cancer diagnosis. Carol also added her son’s family and close friends would sorely miss him.</p><p>“It is with a very heavy heart that the Green and Namatame families announce the passing of their husband, father, son, and brother, Jeremiah Green.
