He concluded his remarks by saying,</p><p>“He always maintained in all the interviews that ‘Amigos,’ the song, was written because he wanted his kid to be his closest buddy, and it came true and he knew it, so that leaves me alone.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Marciano-Cantero-1.webp alt="Marciano Cantero" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Marciano Cantero caused of death</h2><p>Marciano Cantero was admitted to a private facility in Mendoza, Argentina, on September 7 owing to a renal issue that required surgery.
