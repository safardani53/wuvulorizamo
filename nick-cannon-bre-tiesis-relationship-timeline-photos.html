News’ Daily Pop</a>&nbsp;</i>in March 2022, two months after revealing her pregnancy. “I’ve always come back.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “I just respect and love who he is so much as a person, that when I thought about, ‘Do I want my son to be this person? Look at your characteristics, look at your personality, look at how you treat people.’ That’s what is so much more important to me than anything. And he treats me amazing,&nbsp;so that’s all I look at.”</p><p class=p1>The couple <a href=#>have remained close through the years</a>, with Tiesi even appearing on several episodes of his&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Wild ’N Out</a>&nbsp;</i>series, before they announced <a href=#>they were expanding their family</a>.</p><p class=p1>Cannon, who was <a href=#>photographed at Tiesi’s baby shower</a> earlier that month,<a href=#> confirmed the paternity of her new bundle of joy</a> during an episode of his eponymous<i>&nbsp;Nick Cannon Show</i>&nbsp;where he revealed they were in a “great space” as a couple.</p><p class=p1>“When a life comes into this world, it’s a celebration. I’m excited,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Masked Singer</a>&nbsp;</i>host gushed at the time. “I’m happy. I’m gonna be the best dad I can possibly be.”</p><p class=p1>Legendary,<a href=#>&nbsp;the real estate agent’s first child</a>, arrived in July 2022. Cannon, for his part, first became a parent in 2011 when he and then-wife <a href=#><strong>Mariah Carey</strong> </a>welcomed<a href=#> twins Moroccan and Monroe</a>. He also shares <a href=#>Golden,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Powerful</a> and <a href=#>Rise Messiah</a>, born in 2017, 2020 and 2022, respectively, with <a href=#><strong>Brittany Bell</strong></a>, and <a href=#>twins Zion and Zillion</a>, born in June 2021, with <a href=#><strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong></a>. Cannon and the DJ welcomed their third child together, daughter Beautiful, in November 2022.<a href=#><strong> Alyssa Scott</strong></a>&nbsp;welcomed a baby, son <a href=#>Zen</a>, with&nbsp; Cannon in June 2021. Nearly seven months later, Zen<a href=#> died from a brain tumor</a>. Scott and Cannon’s second child together, <a href=#>daughter Halo</a>, <a href=#>arrived in December 2022</a>. The&nbsp;<i>Love Don’t Cost a Thing&nbsp;</i>actor also shares <a href=#>daughter Onyx</a>, <a href=#>born in September 2022</a>, with <a href=#><strong>LaNisha Cole</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>Tiesi, for her part, was initially <a href=#>enthusiastic about her son joining Cannon’s expansive brood</a>, noting she’s watched <a href=#>how he raises his older children</a>.</p><p class=p1>“He’s great,” Tiesi — whose <a href=#>divorce from <strong>Johnny Manziel</strong> was finalized in November 2021</a> — <a href=#>exclusively told<i>&nbsp;Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;in April 2022</a>. “I hear him on the phone [with his kids]. I hear stories. I hear stuff about the kids, and I know him very well. [I’ve been able] to watch him parent and [see] his patience and … his insight and how he explains things. He is just a very nurturing, loving human. Very constructive.”</p><p class=p1>She noted at the time that she has plenty of “love and respect” for <a href=#>Cannon’s relationships with his other children’s mothers</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Our kids are siblings,” Tiesi explained. “However they decide to go moving forward with their dad, that’s their time and their intimate stuff. We’re just here to support and drop off or pick up or whatever they need. But [it’s] all love. We all are worried about our situation and our children and [doing] the best we can do. If anyone needs something, my door is always open.”</p><p class=p1>While Tiesi and the&nbsp;<i>Drumline&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>are committed to raising their first child together</a>, a baby boy, they are <a href=#>not in a traditional monogamous relationship</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“It’s not necessarily anything,” she explained during an appearance on the<a href=#> “Know For Sure” podcast</a> in June 2022. “This is just us, this is our relationship and what you do outside of that is what you do outside of that. Everything is respectful, everything is honest. We don’t really define it.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below for Cannon and Tiesi’s relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNku6qvymaamqaepLturtGeZK2hlai2tHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkraGdmrmqusRmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amber-heard-plunging-slit-dress-legs-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shows Off Toned Legs Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-and-asia-kate-dillon-had-a-powerful-exchange.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashian and Asia Kate Dillon Had a Powerful Exchange</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
