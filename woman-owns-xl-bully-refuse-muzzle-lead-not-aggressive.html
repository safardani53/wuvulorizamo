I don't care. It's not happening. I'm not doing it," she said in a<a href=# aria-label=" video on her TikTok page.

Why? My dog's not aggressive. She doesn't need a muzzle on her."</p><p>And as for putting her on the lead all the time, Daniella won't be doing that either.</p><p>"Mine's on a lead when she needs to be, and when we get to the park - and I don't mean like a kids' playground area, I'm talking like country park, like fields, huge open space park, my dog's off the lead," she said.</p><p>"That's it.</p><p>"If you don't like dogs, you're scared of dogs and you're coming towards me, I'll grab my dog respectfully and hold her.</p><p>"If there's a massive group of kids or we're going to go past a play area, I'll grab the dog and put her on a lead.</p><p>"Unless we've had an interaction and you've told me it's ok for my dog to be around you."</p><p>Concluding, she said: "It's not happening. I'm not muzzling her. And she's not going to be on the lead 24/7."</p><p>"I understand it's better than us losing our dogs, but why should we all just roll over and let our dogs suffer?" she added in the video caption.</p><p>"How will she defend herself if she needs to? She can't play with plastic bottles anymore? She can't play with footballs?</p><p>"Kids won't want to play with her because she'll look scary?</p><p>"I'm sorry but no, and for everyone saying well then you'll lose her.. i promise you now i wont go down without a fight!"</p><p>Daniella then clarified a few points in another video, as she said that she will muzzle train her dog if it comes to either that or the dog being taken away from her.</p><p>But she's willing to fight so she doesn't have to make that decision.</p><p>In <a href=# aria-label="another video, (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">another video, </a>Daniella showed herself walking her dog "unmuzzled, unaggressive and unbothered".</p><p>However, people were quick to comment on the clip, with one writing: "Guess what the owners of the bully dogs who killed people also said they werenâ€™t aggressive before they killed."</p><p>"You're gonna ruin it for other people," another argued.</p><p>"Your ignorance is astounding," a third wrote.</p><p>"ALL dogs have the potential to strike.</p><p>"You don't have the strength to intervene should it happen."</p><p>"Good direction to go in if you want to lose your dog," someone else commented.</p><p>As well as fighting her fight, Daniella is also doing her best to help other XL Bully owners, and has rehomed three of the dogs in recent weeks.</p><p>"I decided to start helping to home bullys since there are so many in need especially with everything going on!" she wrote.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"And in four days 3 have found their forever homes!"&nbsp;</p><p>In the comments on that video, the majority of people praised her for her work, although others insisted she needed to take the XL Bully ban seriously.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/5cb3e6ce-f39b-42e4-a29b-5996aa7b843b.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FtaXFwZGZ9cMPOppinZZ%2Bsu7R516Vkm62cocZuvsSfrKydXaLCu8bLnmSlnZGZeq%2B702aYoJ%2BimsC0tdWeZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kaley-cuoco-bare-breast-brad-goreski.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kaley Cuoco Bare Breast Brad Goreski</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./guinness-world-records-crowns-a-new-hottest-pepper-pepper-x-8364180.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Guinness World Records Crowns a New Hottest Pepper: Pepper X</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
