But fans may not know too much about the actor’s personal life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Michael was married <strong>Caroline McWilliams</strong> in 1982 but the pair divorced in 1990. Although he dated&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Courtney Cox </strong></a>from 1990 to 1995, he hasn’t been publicly linked to anyone else in a serious relationship capacity since then. Here we take a look at his first and only marriage to Caroline and what you need to know about the actress he loved for eight years.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>She’s Best Known For Her Role In ‘Guiding Light’&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michael-Keaton-Wife-Caroline-McWilliams-ss-post11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Like her then-husband, Caroline was an actor and got her start in television. Her career began on the well-known and long-running soap opera&nbsp;Guiding Light&nbsp;as Janet Mason Norris from 1969 to 1975. After she ended her run on the show, she also appeared in episodes of hit shows like&nbsp;Kojak,&nbsp;Barney Miller&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Incredible Hulk. Caroline also had a role in the sitcom&nbsp;Soap&nbsp;in 1978 and 1979, moving on to be in 49 episodes of&nbsp;Benson&nbsp;thereafter. She went on to appear in various TV pilots in the ’80s, ultimately finding a role on&nbsp;Nearly Departed&nbsp;which was a short-lived 1989 sitcom.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Caroline continued to act through the ’90s, finding roles in&nbsp;Beverly Hills, 90210&nbsp;and&nbsp;Home Improvement. In addition to starring in the 1990 movie&nbsp;Mermaids, Caroline’s last role was as Helene Steele in three episodes&nbsp;of <i>Judging Amy</i> in 2002 and 2003.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>She & Michael Share A Son Together & They Remained Close&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michael-Keaton-Wife-Caroline-McWilliams-ss-post21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Although the former couple was only married about eight years, they share one son together, named&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sean Maxwell Douglas</strong></a>. Born May 27, 1983, Sean went on to become a songwriter and producer, winning awards and writing for various singers like&nbsp;<strong>Jessie J</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Demi Lovato</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Chris Brown</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Madonna</strong>, and more. He notably won a Grammy for his work on&nbsp;<strong>Lizzo</strong>‘s&nbsp;Cuz I Love You&nbsp;and co-wrote&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Rhett</strong>‘s song “Die a Happy Man” which won a slew of awards, including the CMA award for Single of the Year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In addition to being proud of their son, before her death, Michael and Caroline remained close even after their divorce, Michael told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ELLE&nbsp;magazine</a> in 2010. He noted his sister and brother also lost former spouses and told him it would be “harder than you think.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“And the feelings that came up were odd, but not in a bad way, necessarily, because we had remained close,” he stated. “She was a remarkable mom. Sean is the great guy he is because of her—we’ve always been tight, but now the bond’s even tighter. We’re the family now.”</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>She Died Of Multiple Myeloma&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>In February 2010, Caroline’s family told the Los Angeles&nbsp;Times&nbsp;that she had died from complications of multiple myeloma, which, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Cancer Society</a>, is a cancer that comes from malignant plasma cells. While normal cells are in bone marrow and the immune system needs them, when they grow out of control, they “produce a tumor called plasmacytoma.” When an individual has one single plasma cell tumor, it’s called an isolated plasmacytoma, but when they have more than one, it’s multiple myeloma.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Caroline was survived by of course Michael and their son Sean as well as her sisters Kelly-Jo Dvareckas, Norma Liedtke and Patti McWilliams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yimqGZlaF6rLHAraanZaees6Z5wpqpqKSZo7JuucKwoKWkmZa6tHmTb3BvcGdmfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bruce-seldon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Bruce Seldon net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hulk-hogan-wife-get-baptized-8419242.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Greatest Day of My Life'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
