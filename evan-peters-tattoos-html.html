Instead of covering it for the show, it perfectly fits into the depiction of chaos and confusion that he brought into the family of Wanda and Vision.&nbsp;</p><h2>Evan Peters' Tattoo on WandaVision</h2><p>At the very beginning of the episode, Peters was seen in a costume without sleeves to show off his "MOM" tattoo on his upper left arm when he made his entry in <a href=# rel=follow>WandaVision</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Although it is not confirmed by the makers of the series, the ink could be a tribute to Wanda and Pietro's mother, who died during the bombings of Sokovia. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There is no evidence indicating that Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver&nbsp;from&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron had a tattoo, so it could also&nbsp;be another way of conveying Pietro's brand new "tough guy" personality that Wanda is unfamiliar with. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Peters' tattoo provides a sense of mystery to his untrustful character as Pietro as he earned Wanda's trust in the first half and then kept mentioning the likelihood of Vision dying again to cause her grief a few moments later.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Story behind Evan Peters' Mom Tattoo</h2><p>In 2014, he recounted the story of this tattoo to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Flaunt </a>magazine, where he said that there's one thing he might always be afraid of, and that is his mother.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"[My mother] said, 'You can get a tattoo as long as it says 'MOM,'"&nbsp;and I was like, okay!" said Peters.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He sketched the "MOM" tattoo on his left arm by himself as a reminder of his mom. He revealed that his parents are in St. Louis, and he often sends them care packages with a stuffed animal of himself.</p><p>"Is that narcissistic?" he asked himself, laughing.&nbsp;"They miss me a lot." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Evan Peters Has a Thumbs up Tattoo on His Right Hand and Regrets It</h2><p>Peters has two tattoos that fans have noticed.&nbsp;Apart from his "MOM" tattoo on his left arm,&nbsp;fans have also seen a tiny red mark on Peters' hand over his tenure on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>American Horror Story.</a> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A stamp-like doodle of a hand giving the thumbs up near his wrist comes from his adventures at a club.&nbsp;During his conversation with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nylon Magazine</a>, he revealed the story of his one tattoo that he regrets having on his body.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><a href=# rel=follow>Peters </a>told the story of a night in a club where he got a&nbsp;thumbs-up stamp on his wrist.</p><p>"When I woke up, I was quite drunk and thought about getting the stamp tattooed permanently on my body," he said. "I regret this tattoo a lot."</p><p>He said that he regrets <a href=# rel=follow>the tattoo</a> because he has to cover up the tattoo during his work. In addition, he often gets questioned if it really is a tattoo or just a stamp, and he hates to&nbsp;keep explaining the same story to people.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2mlrtuvMStnKurXamutcDOqKpnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./humberto-busto.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Humberto Busto</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./doug-jensen-also-know-as-poster-boy-was-sentenced-to-the-prison-for-5-years.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Doug Jensen Also Know As Poster Boy Was Sentenced To The Prison For 5 Years</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
