Starr, the prosecutor whose criminal probe led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton in 1998, was 76 years old when he died as a result of surgical complications.&nbsp;According to PR News Wire, Starr will be laid to rest in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin. His wife, Alice, and three children survive him. According to the BBC, one of Ken’s children, Randall, published a statement saying:</p><p>“We are extremely grieved by the passing of our wonderful and loving father and grandpa, whom we adored for his tireless work ethic but who always prioritized his family.”</p><p>His former colleague Mark Lanier told Politico that the former had been in the Houston hospital’s critical care unit for around four months.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Please pray for the soul of Ken Starr, who has died at 76.

He attended Harding University before moving on to George Washington University. He also attended Brown University and Duke University, where he earned his law degree. Starr’s net worth at the time of his death was $3 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.&nbsp;Starr was hired by the US Department of Justice in 1994 to investigate the 1980s land venture scheme known as Whitewater, which featured Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ken-Starr-1.jpg alt="Ken Starr" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Starr’s investigation lasted five years, during which time he looked into a series of phony property deals involving one of Clinton’s associates, investigated the removal of documents from Vincent Foster’s office after his suicide, and, most importantly, discovered evidence that Bill Clinton was sexually involved with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.&nbsp;Ken Starr presented a report to the US House of Representatives after bringing his affair to light, claiming that Bill Clinton lied under oath and violated the president’s constitutional obligation to enforce legislation. In 1998, the United States House of Representatives impeached Bill Clinton.</p><p>Ken Starr acknowledged in a 2018 CBS interview that he felt terrible for the agony that some individuals had through when Clinton’s romance with Monica Lewinsky became public. He went on to say that “it had to be done” and refused to apologize to her for the fallout.&nbsp;Monica Lewinsky resorted to Twitter after learning of Starr’s death to express her feelings.</p><p>“My thoughts regarding Ken Starr elicit mixed emotions, as I’m sure many will understand… But, more importantly, I suppose it’s a heartbreaking loss for those who loved him.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ken-Starr-2.jpg alt="Ken Starr" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Starr was selected to represent former President Donald Trump during his impeachment trial in 2020. According to Politico, during the trial, Starr delivered a remarkable address in which he said,</p><p>“I believe we are living in the ‘era of impeachment,'” says the author.</p><p>In addition, he said that ‘presidential impeachment is hell.’</p><p>Starr was forced to retire as President of Baylor University in Waco, Texas, in 2016 when it was discovered that the university had not handled sexual assault charges against its football team properly. Starr, on the other hand, proceeded to practice law after being expelled from the university. He taught constitutional law, published many books, and served as a legal expert for Fox News.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiinqZdqMGivtFmp5qro5qxbq3WmrBmmaRiwamxjHBtZpylmnq1u4ysrKuflafGbq%2FOpqeloZOWwaq7zaxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-and-asia-kate-dillon-had-a-powerful-exchange.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashian and Asia Kate Dillon Had a Powerful Exchange</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-dauler.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Dauler</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
