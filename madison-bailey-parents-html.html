She played the role for two seasons.</p><p>In 2021, Bailey was seen portraying the character, Emily, in the action comedy movie,&nbsp;Supercool. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Her upcoming movies,&nbsp;Time Cut and Constance,&nbsp;are in the pipeline.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Madison Bailey was Adopted by Her Foster Parents</h2><p>While Bailey climbed up the ladder in her career, her family, which includes her parents and siblings, played a crucial role in her life by supporting her dreams.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It turns out&nbsp;Bailey was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">adopted</a> by&nbsp;her foster parents Mary Katherine Bailey and Alex Bailey. They raised the actress in&nbsp;Kernersville, North Carolina. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her&nbsp;foster parents previously had a&nbsp;biological son, who is 12 years older than&nbsp;Bailey,&nbsp;after trying multiple times. They, therefore, adopted six children in total, making them parents to seven kids altogether.</p><p>"My parents are angels. They had one kid after trying multiple times, fostered dozens of kids, and then adopted six," she told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">V Magazine</a> in September&nbsp;2020. "There are three boys and four girls.

Meanwhile, she lived in&nbsp;her&nbsp;Los Angeles apartment.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Bailey's Growing Relationship with Her Siblings</h2><p>Like any relationship, the bond between siblings in a family is also very crucial in one's life. That is because an individual grows and learns from their siblings while growing up.</p><p>Reflecting on her relationship with her siblings,&nbsp;Bailey said that she had a good bond with all six of them. And during the pandemic, she found time to mature her relationship with them even more.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She first admitted she was a black woman in a predominately white household, before sharing that she noticed a paradigm shift in family discussions during the protests, the <a href=# rel=follow>Black Lives Matter</a> movement, and calls for police reform.</p><p>"With being adopted, a lot of my family is White. A lot of my siblings are White and have reached out to me," she said. "I’ve had conversations with my siblings about things they’d never really thought about, even though I had expressed them in the past."</p><p>The youngest in the family,&nbsp;Bailey usually posts pictures with her dad, and siblings, as well as throwback stories of her mother on her social media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2>Is Madison Bailey Gay?</h2><p>Madison Bailey, who won the <a href=# rel="follow noopener">'Best Kiss</a>' category award alongside Outer Banks&nbsp;co-star <a href=# rel=follow>Rudy Pankow</a>&nbsp;(JJ) at the '2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards,'&nbsp;was diagnosed with<a href=# rel="follow noopener">&nbsp;a borderline personality disorder</a> at the age of 18—the same year she also realized that she was gay and still liked boys.&nbsp;</p><p>This way her dual attraction to both guys and girls made her assume she could be a bi-sexual. However, she guessed she was a pansexual after dating a trans boy who she met in the show.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In 2020,&nbsp;she told&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ET Online</a> that she had been feeling like a pansexual individual her whole life, but only realized it in "recent years." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Bailey also revealed that&nbsp;it was hard for her to come out to her mother, who was from Alabama. But she did and the loving mother accepted her sexuality.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was like, ‘You don't even know anything about me!’ being really melodramatic.'&nbsp;My mom was like, ‘What don't I know about you?’ I was like, ‘You don't even know I've been dating a girl for a month,’ and she goes -- in the thickest southern accent there ever was -- ‘Fine, Madison, be gay,’” she shared how she came out to her mom.</p><p>However, many fans took Bailey coming out publicizing&nbsp;her relationship with her girlfriend,&nbsp;Mariah Linney, in 2020 on TikTok, also as her first-time coming out event.&nbsp;</p><p>The two pair met in May 2020 after Bailey messaged Linney on Instagram after liking a TikTok video of her.</p><p>And it turned out Linney lived nearby Bailey's hotel room&nbsp;in Charleston Carolina,&nbsp;which was 20 minutes away from Lineny's residence.</p><p>After their first meeting, their bond got so stronger and they instantly started <a href=# rel=follow>dating not long after</a>.&nbsp;Bailey even introduced her to his family in Lona Angeles just three days after their meeting.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Since then, the talented actress has been expressing her love and affection towards her partner Linney on her social media. She said,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>I had zero hesitation to post on social media about it because I was like, ‘No matter what happens, you will be in my life forever.’ I care about her so much. She's very gentle-hearted, kind, loving, and you see that in the way she loves basketball [and] her family. You see her loyalty and dedication in the things that she cares about. I think I am in love.</p><p>For her being pansexual is about expressing love—the kind of pure love she shares with her girlfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She said, "Being pansexual is basically just loving people for people, regardless of gender or any type of sexuality or any type of anything.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Nonetheless, she feels lucky to have support from friends, family, and the acting industry.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="follow noopener">To Independent,</a>&nbsp;also in 2020, she told that she was okay with people "want to be in her personal life."</p><p>"To be so transparent, especially in an industry when a lot of people want to be in my personal life, it’s nice that I can be like: ‘Here’s my personal life. You can have it. It’s fine,’” she shared.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And since coming out, her queer fan base has risen at an unprecedented level. She encourages everyone to embrace their sexuality and shares that she&nbsp;didn't believe in straight people</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>If you're gay, tell everybody that you're gay. It's worth it,"&nbsp;he told US Weekly.&nbsp;"I was saying this the other day. I was like, to be honest, I don't believe in straight people.
