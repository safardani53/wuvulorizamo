She was 24. While an official <a href=#>cause of of death</a> has yet to be confirmed, Hampson had no apparent health issues.</p><p>“I can’t believe I am writing these words but my darling Dani – my best friend, my everything and more, the love of my life – passed away in the early hours of Saturday morning, 18th June,” the songwriter wrote <a href=#>via Instagram</a> on June 20 alongside a photo of his late partner holding their 7-month old son, Bowie. “What was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives ended in irreversible heartbreak. I feel like I have cried an ocean.”</p><p>The former <a href=#>Stereo Kicks member</a> continued: “We never made it to the alter [sic]; or got to say our vows, or dance our first dance, but I know you know that you were my entire world and the best thing that has ever happened to me, Danielle. I will wear this ring that I was always supposed to wear as a sign of my unconditional love to you.”</p><p>Further in his post, Mann wrote that he was “completely broken” by the loss but promised to call on “any strength I can muster” to <a href=#>care for their infant</a>, who was <a href=#>born in October 2021</a>. “I will not be a mark on the parent that you had already become but I promise I will do my everything to raise Bowie just the way we always wanted,” the U.K. native wrote. “I promise you he will know how amazing his mummy was. I promise to make you so so proud.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Tom_Mann-Shares-Heartbreaking-Message-to-Fiancee-Dani-Hampson-Following-Her-Death.jpg><p>The couple, who were first linked in 2016, <a href=#>got engaged in 2019</a>.
