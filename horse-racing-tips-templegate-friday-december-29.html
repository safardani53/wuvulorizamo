Ruth Jefferson sent this six-year-old to Sedgefield for his seasonal comeback where he ran an absolute belter. He was just getting going at the end of 2m4f at that stamina-sapping track when beaten just a head. The handicapper has been fair with a 4lb rise in the weights and it doesn’t matter what the weather does because he has run well on bottomless and good going. This race looks no tougher than last time and the longer trip can see him back in front.</p><p><strong>ONEMOREFORTHEROAD (1.05 Doncaster, nb)</strong></p><p>Neil King’s chaser enjoyed himself in South Yorkshire earlier this month when coming home a convincing winner on Town Moor. He showed plenty of pace for this two-mile trip that day and enjoyed being on the front end for most of the contest. That was an impressive effort on his chasing debut and his jumping looked much better than over hurdles. The handicapper wasn’t dozing and has shunted him up 8lb but that was an excellent effort and there should be a lot of improvement to come with that under his belt.</p><p><strong>ZAMBELLA (1.40 Doncaster, treble)</strong></p><p>Rarely runs a bad race and was in blistering form when scoring by 17 lengths at Aintree last time. She travelled really sweetly in that Listed contest and had the race won a long way from home. That built on a good fourth at the Cheltenham Festival and she has an impressive eight wins in this grade — including the past two renewals of this race.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Virgin Bet: Bet £10 Get £20 in free bets - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only. £/€10 min stake (if EW then min £/€10 Win + £/€10 Place).

He kicked off with a smart debut success at Warwick in May before returning to more than match that with a seven-length success here last time. His rider had the luxury of cantering the final 100 yards such was his superiority. He is 9lb higher for that bloodless success but that won’t put the brakes on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Templegate's tips and Irish selections</h2><p>Leopardstown</p><p>12.00 Sweet Will<br>12.35 Ballyburn<br>1.10 Risk Belle (nb)<br>1.45 Corbetts Cross (NAP)<br>2.20 Impaire Et Passe<br>2.55 Waterford Whispers<br>3.25 Jalon D'oudairies</p><p>Limerick</p><p>12.20 R'evelyn Pleasure<br>12.55 Evies Vladimir<br>1.30 Ossie's Lodge<br>2.05 Splashing Out<br>2.35 Iceberg Theory<br>3.10 Marciano<br>3.42 Johngus</p><p>DONCASTER</p><p>11.55 Jaytee<br>Good winner over course and distance last time.</p><p>12.30 Ezmerellda<br>Will find this easier than Listed race on debut.</p><p>1.05 Onemorefortheroad (nb)<br>Good win on chase debut over course and distance latest.</p><p>1.40 Zambella (treble)<br>Has won the past two runnings of this race.</p><p>2.15 Bhaloo<br>Good third on hurdles debut and has more to come.</p><p>2.45 Twinjets<br>Had plenty in hand when scoring here last time out.</p><p>3.20 Wholeofthemoon<br>Can cope with 7lb rise for winning here latest.</p><p>KELSO</p><p>12.10 Great Pepper<br>Points winner who scored well at Hexham last time out.</p><p>12.45 Hashtag Boum (nap)<br>Good second last time and this looks a good chance.</p><p>1.20 Traprain Law<br>Consistent and excellent debut third on chase debut latest.</p><p>1.55 Young Buster<br>Two good wins including easily here last time out.</p><p>2.28 Ip Up<br>Went close at Musselburgh and form is working out well.</p><p>3.02 Ballyfort<br>Solid effort at Ayr last time and hood may help.</p><p>3.32 Gipsy Lee Rose<br>Battled well to score over course and distance latest.</p><p>SOUTHWELL</p><p>4.00 King Of York<br>Overdue a win but good effort over course and distance latest.</p><p>4.30 Camacho Star<br>Regular winner who can cope with 4lb rise for last win.</p><p>5.00 Gold Aura<br>Keeps hitting the frame and will be on the premises again.</p><p>5.30 Jazzy Angel<br>Battled strongly when scoring here last time out.</p><p>6.00 Educator<br>Good Flat form and makes debut for canny trainer here.</p><p>6.30 Hiya Maite<br>Likes this track and ran another good race latest.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>7.00 Tyke<br>Just pipped over course and distance last time out.</p><p>7.30 Smasher<br>Went close at Chelmsford and should go close again.</p><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
