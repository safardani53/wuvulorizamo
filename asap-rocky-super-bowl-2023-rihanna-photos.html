At one point, he reached his hands in the air and seemed like he was cheering and applauding the amazing concert. He smiled wide as he took it all in. He was rocking a leather jacket with an American flag design and the NFL logo on it, as well as khaki slacks and a trucker hat, as he watched RiRi’s performance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Rihanna’s epic halftime performance comes at a special time in her life. She and A$AP Rocky recently became first-time parents when they welcomed their son in May, and now they’re expecting another little one. The couple both clearly took to being parents, and they’ve been seen out and about with their baby boy on a few occasions. Rocky seems incredibly happy to be a dad! The “Same Problems” rapper <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>opened up about fatherhood</a> in an interview with&nbsp;<strong>Zane Lowe&nbsp;</strong>on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Apple Music 1</a> in January. “I’m a member of our club now, like the dad club. You see a dad, you see me. I’m playing on, I’m a full dad now,” he said. “You come home to heaven every day. I’m so thankful. God is good, man.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ASAP-Rocky-Supports-Rihanna-Sb-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>In the lead-up to the halftime show, Rocky did have so many great things to say about Rihanna’s performance before she took the stage in that interview. “This is incredible. I’m so glad that my lady’s back making music again and whatnot, and getting back out there,” he said. “The Super Bowl is huge, and her being the creative [force] she is, she going to bring it, man. I’m excited. I’m more excited than everybody else, honestly.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>As RiRi got ready for the Super Bowl, a source close to the pair revealed to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>exclusively that the rapper was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>taking on more parenting duties</a> to give her room to get ready. “Rocky has committed to taking on more of the baby care duties so Rihanna can focus&nbsp;on preparing,” they said. “Rocky couldn’t be more proud of Rihanna for landing the&nbsp;Super Bowl Halftime Show. He knows it’s not a decision she’s taken lightly, but it’s going to be one of the greatest highlights of her life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ASAP-Rocky-Rihanna-SB-Halftime-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>While Rihanna is the main focus of the Super Bowl halftime show, Rocky spent much of the year entertaining fans at concerts of his own, performing at a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> number of festivals</a> all over the world, with his most recent performance being at Amazon Music Live in December. The “Umbrella” singer joined her boyfriend for a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>number of his concerts</a>, including her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first public outing</a> after she gave birth to their son. It only makes sense that the rapper would be there to support her at her first performance in years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>While Rocky and Rihanna have had so much to celebrate over the last year, and it’s sure that they’ll have even more in 2023, the rapper has been facing a legal issue since last year. He was charged with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>assault with a deadly weapon</a> in August 2022 for an alleged incident that occurred in Hollywood in November 2021. Rocky <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pleaded not guilty</a> to the charges in August.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5BrZpqrkaV6s7vCpLBmq6WlsrN5waiupWViZX90edGin5qmnpZ6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-conway-dead-the-carol-burnett-show-actor-dies-at-85.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Conway Dead: The Carol Burnett Show Actor Dies at 85</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kristen-bell-shares-touching-tribute-for-dax-shepard-49th-birthday-8421413.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kristen Bell Shares Tribute for Her 'Love' Dax Shepard's 49th Birthday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
