the new documentary, Everybody's Everything has got people talking, with many becoming suspicious about exactly how the rapper died.</p><p><a href=#>Lil Peep, whose real name was Gustav Ahr</a>, was found dead on his tour bus in Arizona in 2017.</p><p>The star tested positive for Fentanyl, Xanax, marijuana, cocaine and Tramadol, as well as a number of other powerful prescription opiates.</p><p>The documentary explored whether Lil Peep died by accident, or if he took his own life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

brother as "super happy with where he was in life" and insisting he "was not struggling".</p><p>Private messages between Lil Peep and 20-year-old fan Mariah Bons surfaced soon after his death.</p><p>In the messages Bons described getting the star "high af" and that she "tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up."</p><p>The documentary revealed the Xanax Bons may have given Lil Peep was laced with Fentanyl and he did not know it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

sold them "bad Xanax" which they said "almost killed them".</span></p><p>Police initially investigated Mariah after Lil Peep's death, but subsequently cleared her of any wrongdoing.</p><p>Mariah denied any responsibility in his death and she also died at the age of 21 in July last year.</p><p>Fans watching the documentary became convinced Lil Peep was murdered and took to Twitter in anger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Twitter.</p><p>Another added: "Someone killed Lil Peep intentionally, I’m convinced."</p><p>"LIL PEEP WAS MURDERED," exclaimed one Twitter user, while another went deeper on the conspiracy theory.</p><p>"That Lil Peep documentary was crazy...
