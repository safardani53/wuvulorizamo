(Chalamet stars as Willy Wonka in the <a href=#>new movie musical</a>, which hits theaters on Friday, December 15.)</p><p>“Kylie really didn’t want to make a huge scene when she attended the Wonka premiere, so she decided to skip the carpet and make a low-key entrance,” the source told Us. “This night was all about Timothée and she didn’t want to take away from that in any way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kylie-Jenner-and-Timothee-Chalamet-Are-Fairly-Serious-and-Focus-on-Making-Time-to-See-Each-Other-066.jpg><p>The Wonka premiere is not the first time Kylie has subtly supported her boyfriend at one of his events. Last month, Kylie celebrated Chalamet’s Saturday Night Live hosting gig <a href=#>at the afterparty</a>. She arrived at the gathering in a <a href=#>black off-the-shoulder top</a> and black leggings, while Chalamet donned bright colors with his blue hoodie and purple jacket.</p><p>Chalamet, for his part, supported Kylie at the <a href=#>WSJ. Innovator Awards</a> earlier that month, where she was honored as the magazine’s 2023 Brand Innovator for her new clothing brand, <a href=#>Khy</a>.
