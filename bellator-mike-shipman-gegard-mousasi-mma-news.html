And I realised that I wasn't doing that in that Fabian fight.</p><p>"I kind of got so caught up in the rivalry and the animosity and wanting to hand him his first loss that I wasn't enjoying myself in the fight. I wasn't present in it and I wasn't doing the things that I should've done.</p><p>"I wasn't fighting. I was trying to stop him from winning. I wasn't enjoying myself the way I should've been.</p><p>"That kind of thing will not only affect your performance, it steals the real prize of fighting. Which is being very present in that moment.</p><p>"Who knows how many you're going to have?&nbsp; That's the other thought that came to me.</p><p>"Anything can happen. You can get injured in training - the pandemic really brought it home."</p><p>Being present again translated to a dominant performance for Shipman against the durable Pennini, although he wasn't completely satisfied with his display at the Ex PalaLido.</p><p>He admitted: "There were a few little bits and bobs I wasn't happy with. But generally, I was happy with that performance because I was enjoying myself.&nbsp;</p><p>Having that break and being forced to step away really kind of allowed me to put stuff into perspective and think about what I want to get out of fighting and what I'm doing it</p><span class=quote-credit>Mike Shipman</span><p>"I was there, I could see everything that was happening.
