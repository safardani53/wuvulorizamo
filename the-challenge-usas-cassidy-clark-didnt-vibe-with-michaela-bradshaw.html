I think we <a href=#>play our games very differently</a>, and that made us clash a lot,” Cassidy continued. “I don’t do well with really manipulative people just from my past. I get very triggered by it because I went through a relationship that was very abusive in that way.”</p><p>While Cassidy emphasized that she wasn’t implying that anyone from her season was abusive, she noted that she doesn’t respond well to manipulation as a gameplay tactic.</p><p>“It works for some people and they’re able to play a really strategic, really calculated game — and good for them. But I don’t like when people try to make me feel small with their intelligence or try to strong-arm me into doing something or just play mind games with me. I don’t vibe with that,” she said. “I’ve learned to stick up for myself when I feel like I’m being manipulated. So, I think for those reasons, we couldn’t really click.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Challenge-USA-s-Cassidy-Clark-Explains-Why-She-Didn-t-Vibe-With-Michaela-Bradshaw-273.jpg><p>Cassidy also named Challenge veteran <a href=#><strong>Wes Bergmann</strong></a> as someone she found hard to connect with due to his approach to the game.</p><p>“I never felt like I could get close to people like [Michaela] or Wes because it just always felt like there was some hidden motive or they were using me for their own gameplay and they didn’t actually care about me as a person,” she said. “Which is fine, but I don’t know, I don’t build my relationships in the game that way.”</p><p>Despite being eliminated just ahead of the final, Cassidy proved herself to be a strong competitor this season. She was sent into the Arena four times, winning her first three face-offs against <a href=#><strong>Alyssa Lopez</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Alyssa Snider</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Michele Fitzgerald</strong></a>. She ultimately lost a Hall Brawl to <a href=#><strong>Chanelle Howell</strong> </a>during the Thursday, October 12, episode.</p><p>“It doesn’t get acknowledged enough, the mental toll that it takes on someone to go into the Arena so many times and to be nominated so many times,” Cassidy told Us.</p><p>Although she faced an uphill battle to make it to the final 10 competitors, Cassidy is glad the season played out the way it did.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“If I could have played a game where I didn’t have to go in [to the Arena] so many times, I probably would’ve jumped at that chance. [But] would it have allowed me to have the story that I did and prove myself in the way I did? No,” she said. “Looking back, I prefer the path that I took and the journey that I had to go on because it allowed me to have such an epic rookie season.”</p><p>The Challenge: USA airs on CBS Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2YtaK4y56loJ1dqsCiv4ycmKyrmZnGbq%2FLmqmkZZSesa%2FAjK%2Bgm51drLa1tIymoJygkZq5onnBq5idq5iWxHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./koe-wetzel-real-name-wife-from-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Koe Wetzel from and What Is His Real Name?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rory-culkin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rory Culkin Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
