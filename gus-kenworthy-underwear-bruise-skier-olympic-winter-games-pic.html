At least he had a sense of humor about it. Gus’s raunchy joke – not to mention, spoiler alert, dude – was accompanied by a picture of the U.S. skier with his pants pulled down to his thighs. Granted, that was the only way he was going to show off the bruise and he did keep his underwear on. Gus’s picture raises an interesting question – can a painful looking bruise be sexy?</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Gus got this painful souvenir from the 2018 Winter Olympics during practice on Feb. 16, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Washington Post</a>. A day after fracturing his thumb, Gus took a tumble while training. The hematoma was so severe that he said he needed medical personnel to drain 140 ccs of blood from his backside. “Ultrasound — just got here,” he said on Instagram, “and my butt’s about to get drained. . . . I have a freakin’ booty right now and I feel like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>[figure skater]<strong> Adam Rippon</strong> </a>in his ice skating pants.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I wasn’t allowed to film the draining process because of Olympic or medical or something rules, but look at how much blood just came out.” He then shared a picture of six syringes filled with blood. Yikes. Oh, by the way, that Adam comment? That wasn’t shade, but more of Gus paying a compliment to his USA teammate (and Adam’s booty.) He took Feb. 17 off to cheer on Adam during the men’s figure skating free skate competition before watching the women’s slopesstyle race</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In between breaking this thumb and bruising his peach, Gus might want to forget the 2018 Olympics, right? Wrong. While he didn’t repeat his silver medal-winning performance from 2014, he provided what will be an iconic moment from the games at the end of his run. His boyfriend, <strong>Matt Wilkas</strong>, met him at the finish line and greeted him with a quick kiss on the lips, a bit of PDA captured by the NBC cameras, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>USA Today</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A peach hasn't been this destroyed since Timothée Chalamet in Call Me by Your Name.🍑 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/GSpdjZGox2</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— Gus Kenworthy (@guskenworthy) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 20, 2018</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Didn’t realize this moment was being filmed yesterday but I’m so happy that it was,” he tweeted. Gus came out in 2015&nbsp;and this was his first Winter games where he competed as an openly gay man. “My childhood self would never have dreamed of seeing a gay kiss on TV at the Olympics but for the first time ever a kid watching at home CAN! Love is love is love.” And it’s good to know he has a boyfriend who will help take care of that bruise when they get home.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think of Gus’s bruise? Does that make you want to stay indoors or are you going to hit the slopes this weekend?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH1ze5FpZqCto2K4prrWqKmtoKliwq%2BwxKuunpmiYq%2BzwcisnGarm56ys3nOpbCmqJmYeri1za2cq2WXlrqmv4ypoJxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sex-and-the-city-the-ladies-boyfriends-husbands.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Ladies Boyfriends &amp;amp; Husbands Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maverick-leonard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maverick Leonard- Age, Bio, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
