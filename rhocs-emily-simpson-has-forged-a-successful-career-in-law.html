class=wp-block-heading id=emilys-law-career-explored>Emily’s law career explored</h2><p>Simpson is an intelligent woman and this is clear to see from her two degrees that have come in very handy with her law work.</p><p>According to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> profile, the lawyer studied at Miami University from 1994 to 1998 where she obtained her Bachelor’s of Education in Spanish Language and Literature.</p><p>Before studying for her second degree, Emily became a high school Spanish teacher for four years but always knew she was destined for more.</p><p>Her second degree was in Law and she worked for this from 2003-2005 at the prestigious Thomas Jefferson School of Law. After her studies were complete she got a job pretty much straight away and began working as a real estate consultant.</p><p>This lasted two years before she decided to make a career move to Salt Lake City in Utah where she began working as an associate attorney. This only lastest a year before Simpson moved to her most recent and longest position at Higbee and Asscocoaties in 2017 where she worked as a family paralegal before being promoted to a copyright attorney for the same firm.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Emily Simpson (@rhoc_emilysimpson)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=emily-has-big-plans-for-her-latest-career-endeavour>Emily has big plans for her latest career endeavour</h2><p>The RHOC star recently announced that she has her sights set on something big and important to her within her field and told her fans she is now working with the Californian Innocence Project.</p><p>CIP is an organisation that works to free those inmates that have been wrongfully convicted of crimes as well as “working to reform the criminal justice system, and train students to become zealous advocates.”</p><p>Simpson spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheDailyDish</a> about her latest career move and explained:</p><p>I’ve always been interested in the Innocence Project. I’ve actually watched lots of series and documentaries about wrongfully convicted people who have spent large amounts of time in jail and then have their convictions overturned by certain organizations, like the Innocence Project.</p><p>The reality star and lawyer went on to say that the project has been something she has always wanted to partake in and said she felt like now was the “right time,” she continued:</p><p>There’s different Innocence Projects in each state and city. It’s just been something that I really, really, really was interested in. And I always wanted to volunteer with them. But I always worked full time as an attorney and then now I just feel like I’m in a position where I’m not working as an attorney full time so I wanted to use the time, my downtime to volunteer with them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by California Innocence Project (@ca_innocence)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-organisation-have-shared-their-excitement-at-emily-joining>The organisation have shared their excitement at Emily joining</h2><p>CIP are active on their social media and recently shared a statement expressing their excitement and gratitude with Emily joining their team, the post said:</p><p>We are so happy to welcome new CIP Board Member, Emily Simpson!
