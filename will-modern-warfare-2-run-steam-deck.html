The Call of Duty games have faced some criticism lately, and Activision has decided to <a href=#>take a year off</a> from putting out another installment amid mixed reviews from players, but from what's been seen in Modern Warfare 2, it seems the upcoming title may be one of the best the developer has put out in some time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Modern Warfare 2 will be available on Steam at launch — which makes those who have managed to get their hands on the <a href=#>Steam Deck</a> wonder if they can play it.</p><p>Unfortunately, since Activision implemented a serious set of anti-cheat features, there are only certain operating systems that will run the game — and as the Steam Deck runs on Arch, a variation of Linux, the compatibility is brought into question.</p><p>Can you run the new Modern Warfare 2 on Valve's Steam Deck?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">No, 'Modern Warfare 2' will not run on the Steam Deck at launch.</h2><p>Activision uses an anti-cheating program known at Ricochet, which, unfortunately, is not compatible with Linux operating systems. As Linux users still only make up a small portion of Call of Duty users, Activision has yet to make the two programs compatible, meaning those attempting to run Modern Warfare on the Steam Deck at launch won't be able to participate in online multiplayer.</p><p>That being said, just because it won't be compatible at launch doesn't mean that the developers won't find a way to make the game run on the Steam Deck in the future. As the Steam Deck becomes a much more easily accessible console, with quick shipping times, it's likely the developers will be pressured to consider the console's players with new updates.</p><p>In addition to this, there are also workarounds you can implement in the meantime — and they won't get you banned.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to play 'Modern Warfare 2' on the Steam Deck.</h2><p>Though the game won't be compatible with the console at launch, players can work around this issue by downloading a Windows operating system onto their Steam Deck. As the Steam Deck is meant to be a fully functional PC, this is entirely possible to do, though it's not necessarily easy.</p><p>To do this, you'll need to download Windows to a USB drive, or download it directly to the Steam Deck through its PC mode. Beware though: doing so may require you to delete the original SteamOS.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Instead of explaining all of the steps necessary, we've linked the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">handy video</a> above to help you out.</p><p>Doing this will also allow you to play other games that have compatibility issues, like Destiny 2, on the Steam Deck. Modern Warfare 2 is not the only game that uses this anti-cheat system, so if you're a fan of online FPS games, then this may be an upgrade for your console.</p><p>If this seems too complicated, you can also wait until the developers release patch updates that make the games compatible with the Steam Deck, though not all of them have guaranteed that there is a patch in the works. It may be some time before such a fix is implemented, so only do this if you're planning on playing a lot of games like Modern Warfare 2 on your console.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIympp2doqN6uK3Rn5irnV1nerPBzWaqrZ2RonqlscKk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./corey-calliet.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Corey Calliet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./corey-feldman-sexual-abuse-corey-haim-book.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Its Important To Reveal Corey Haims Sexual Abuse Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
