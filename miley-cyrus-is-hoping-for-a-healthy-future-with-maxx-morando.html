(Cyrus was previously married to <strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong>, whom she began dating in 2009. The duo split in 2019 after less than one year of marriage.)</p><p>Us confirmed in February 2022 that Cyrus and Morando were “exploring things and seeing where it goes,” but Cyrus had actually name-dropped Morando during an interview months prior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Miley-Cyrus-Can-See-a-%E2%80%98Healthy-and-%E2%80%98Positive-Future-With-Boyfriend-Maxx-Morando-Source101.jpg><p>“This look is a one-of-a-kind collaboration between two of my favorite emerging artists, Maxx Morando and <strong>Shane Kastl</strong>,” she said during a September 2021 interview with Vogue. “Their collaboration is the perfect example of sustainability becoming the next fashion phase, and it proves that anything can be reinvented, which resonates with me deeply.”</p><p>In November of that year, Cyrus posed with Morando at the <a href=#>Gucci Love Parade</a> event, but things didn’t get romantic until the following year.</p><p>“We got put <a href=#>on a blind date</a>,” Cyrus told British Vogue this past May, revealing that her first outing with Morando occurred a few summers ago. “Well, it was blind for me and not really for him. I thought, ‘The worst that can happen is I leave.’”</p><p>Things worked out <a href=#>for the twosome</a>. When news of Cyrus and Morando’s relationship first broke, a separate source told Us in March 2022 that the couple was “having fun and have been spending a lot of time together.”</p><p>The insider went on to say that Cyrus and Morando were “very compatible with each other” and had been “exploring things and seeing where it goes.”</p><p>When Cyrus was working on her <a href=#>Endless Summer Vacation</a> album, which was released in March, Morando was a big help. He even produced two songs on the record.</p><p>“My boyfriend brings his phone and I don’t bring one. I had no way of knowing what number it would [chart at], and it wasn’t of importance to me because it wouldn’t have changed anything,” Cyrus told British Vogue of her album. “Someone could say, ‘It would be this number if you did that, or this number if you sell your soul.’ I’ve been in the Garden of Eden before and I’ve taken the red apple, and it never feels good.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When it comes to communicating with Morando, however, Cyrus told the outlet she has a special “boyfriend sexy ringtone” for her man.</p><p>For more details on Cyrus and Morando’s romance, watch the video above and pick up <a href=# rel=noopener>the new issue</a> of Us Weekly, on stands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZyaxm6v2KusrGWZqHqpu8%2BipaBllqS%2Fbq2MoZyapKSdxm6y1K2sq51drLa1tIymmLGwXaK8s63NnaZo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oscar-vazquez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Oscar Vazquez Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michiel-vos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michiel Vos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
