During an appearance on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live on Wednesday, May 15, the actor revealed to host <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> that his offscreen love, <strong>Jane Musky</strong>, doesn't watch the show, largely because of the steamy sex scenes he has with his costar.</p><p>Goldwyn, 52, plays President Fitzgerald Grant, who has had a torrid, on-again/off-again affair with Washington's character, Olivia Pope, since season one. Their relationship is a driving force in the series; love scenes between the two are frequent and intense. Asked by a fan what Musky (married to the star since 1989) thinks of the fiery connection, Goldwyn laughed. "It's a problem," he quipped.</p><p>"The honest answer is, my wife doesn't watch it," he continued. "She watched the pilot and thought it was great, but yeah…I don't encourage it."</p><p>His daughters <strong>Anna</strong> and <strong>Tess</strong>, however, are big fans. "My two girls think it's hilarious. Disgusting and hilarious. So they send me all kinds of rude texts," he said, citing one occasion on which his 18-year-old messaged him a particularly racy video clip from the show with a note saying, "Excuse me?!"</p><p>For Goldwyn, the love scenes are just part of the job. But he admitted there have been times when even he's felt uncomfortable with them. "The most embarrassing one for me was when I had to direct my own sex scene," he said, explaining how he had to talk Washington through the positions he wanted to film.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Asked whether he ever got too…excited, he joked: "Well, if you think about doing a sex scene with 30 overweight men staring at you, it's hot."</p><p>The season two finale of Scandal airs Thursday, May 16, on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuopqlitLC4w7Cwp2WjmK6vsMClZKydqGLApLHNnqpmr5mptW63xKupsmWnlsCptc2gq6imXZa%2FpnnAZqerp5Khsq55xaipZqWpYsSqssRmaWlpY2aDdns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./doraaj2pqcmtcev6s3tc1aespmn1l8ez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Gunsmoke Season 14 Episode 2: The Hide-Cutters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-ripa-bangs-hair-makeover-pamela-anderson-inspired-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pamela Anderson Inspired Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
