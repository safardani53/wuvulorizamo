The Blaugrana are now looking to appoint club legend Xavi as their next manager, according to multiple sources. The current Al-Sadd boss is said to have agreed to the move, and it’s only a matter of time before it’s made official.</p><p>Xavi, like everyone else, is well aware of the turmoil that Barcelona is currently experiencing. The former player will be eager to make an immediate impact on the team in order to right the Blaugrana’s ship. He, like other managers, is likely to make changes to the squad.</p><p>Fortunately, the transfer window reopens in January, and Xavi will be looking to add a few players to the Barcelona squad. On that note, here are five players who the Spaniard could entice to Camp Nou during the winter transfer window:</p><h2>#5 Defensive&nbsp; management</h2><p>Xavi is interested in <strong>Jules Kounde</strong></p><p>The Frenchman could assist Xavi in addressing Barcelona’s defensive shortcomings.</p><p>In recent seasons, Barcelona’s defense has been nothing to write home about. Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba are already past their primes, while Ronald Araujo and Samuel Umtiti have suffered from injuries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jules-Kounde.jpg><p>Jules Koundé has been requested by Xavi.</p><p>It is obvious that strengthening the backline will be one of the first priorities for Xavi when he takes over the club. Sevilla’s center-back Jules Kounde is one player who could improve Blaugrana’s defensive options.</p><p>During the summer, the Frenchman was linked with a move to Camp Nou, and he remains a target for the club. Because of his technical abilities, Kounde would be a good fit in Xavi’s system. The 22-year-old has been one of La Liga’s best defenders in recent seasons, putting in rock-solid performances.</p><h2>#4 Regular Striker</h2><p>Xavi is interested in Uruguayan striker <strong>Edinson Cavani</strong></p><p>During the summer, Edinson Cavani was linked with a move to Barcelona. With several offensive players injured, the Blaugrana attempted to sign the striker on loan, but the deal fell through before the transfer window closed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cavani-i.jpg><p>Barcelona is ‘interested in signing Edinson Cavani on loan in January</p><p>Cavani will almost certainly jump at the chance to leave Manchester United for any other top club right now. Following the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo, the Uruguayan has lost its starting spot. While the striker will not be a long-term solution to Barcelona’s attacking problems, he will provide a short-term solution.</p><h2>#3 Priority to Rudiger</h2><p>Rudiger is closer to leaving Chelsea than he has ever been.</p><p>Antonio Rudiger’s time at Chelsea appears to be coming to an end very soon. The defender’s current deal with the Blues is set to expire at the end of the season. There’s a good chance he won’t sign another contract with the Premier League giants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Antonio-Rudiger-i.jpg><p>According to reports, several clubs have entered the race to sign the Chelsea star, with Barcelona among them. The defender is currently regarded as one of Europe’s best center-backs and would undoubtedly strengthen Blaugrana’s defense.</p><p>Antonio Rudiger is reportedly on his way out of Chelsea, with FOUR European powerhouses interested, including two from the Premier League.</p><p>According to Transfermarkt, Rudiger’s market value is currently €35 million. Given that he is under contract with the Champions League holders for less than a year, the Blues may be willing to sell him for a lower price in January.</p><h2>#2 Interested in Spanish talented Midfielder Dani Olmo</h2><p>Dani Olmo’s exceptional versatility would be a huge asset to Barcelona.<br>Olmo’s versatility would be a huge asset to Barcelona.<br>Dani Olmo’s move to Barcelona appears to be a matter of time. During the summer, the Blaugrana attempted but failed to evict the Spaniards. They’ll try again in January, according to reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dani-olmo-i.jpg><p>Olmo is a player with a wide range of technical abilities who would fit in nicely with Xavi’s system. The attacking midfielder is a product of Barcelona’s youth system and is familiar with the club’s core values and playing style.</p><p>Barcelona is interested in signing Dani Olmo in January. Barça already has a contract with the player. The RB Leipzig star is also a versatile player. Olmo can play in any position across the midfield and attack. This would give Xavi more options for testing and implementing new ideas in Barcelona.</p><h2>#1 Raheem Sterling is ranked first as Xavi’s main project</h2><p>According to Xavi, Raheem Sterling is one of the best players in the world right now. Raheem Sterling is a player who Xavi has endorsed on numerous occasions. During an interview in 2019, he stated that the Manchester City attacker is one of the players who could replace Lionel Messi at the top of the game. He stated:</p><p>“I look at the moment – and Sterling is winning that race. He’s always been a good, dangerous player, but under Pep, he’s become one of the best in the world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Raheem-Sterling-i.jpg><p>“I know how Pep works – he would have worked closely with him since his arrival – where he needs to improve and what he needs to work on. We see the results – he’s still young and can be the world’s best.”</p><p>Raheem Sterling, according to reports, is willing to join Barcelona when the transfer window reopens in January. The Englishman has recently expressed his desire to leave the Etihad Stadium. It remains to be seen whether he ends up at Camp Nou in January.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGivmq6ZYrCwwcudZKyhl6N6uLXToWSbmaKYsq27zZpkoqZdn66vwcCrsGasn6V6dnnPq6ajnZOpeqqyjLGYr6Fdl7KkrcyeZJuZopiyrbvNmmScp5GYtXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brazil-campeonato-brasileirao-serie-a.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Brazil Campeonato Brasileiro Srie A Season 2023 Episode 51: Bahia vs. Flamengo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jonathan-coachman-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jonathan Coachman Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
