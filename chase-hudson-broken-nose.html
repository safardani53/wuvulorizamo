With viral challenges, lip-sync videos, funny skits, and of course dances, the social media platform has given way to a new type of influencer: TikTok star.</p><p>While many people have heard of Addison Rae and Charli D'Amelio, another fellow Hype House member who has skyrocketed into the limelight is <a href=#>Chase Hudson</a> aka LILHUDDY.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The 17-year-old, who recently ended his relationship with Charli, is known for his e-boy style, charming good looks, lip-sync videos, and dance moves. So, who is the teen that currently boasts 19 million followers on the app? Well, before becoming TikTok famous, Chase was involved in a bit of controversy on social media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chase Hudson receives backlash from an old broken nose video after saying a racial slur.</h2><p>Before being on TikTok was deemed "cool," Chase was ahead of the trend and already trying to cultivate a following on the app. In an old video on his account, Chase shared a video on TikTok claiming that a guy broke his nose. "This audio is perfect cuz some drunk guy broke my nose 2 days ago for idek (I don't even know) what reason. #yeet," he captioned the clip.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But, that wasn't the only video of his broken nose that surfaced from Chase's past. Sporting a black eye and a bandage over his nose, a clip of the then-short-haired e-boy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying the n-word was shared</a>. After the video's release, Chase has gone on to apologize in a TikTok video.&nbsp;</p><p>"I just wanted to make an apology video for the video that's been spreading around. What I said was wrong and doesn't need to be defended. What I said was not right in any way and should not be used by my mouth or anyone else's," he said. Additionally, the teen also said that he was apologizing to both the TikTok and "black community." &nbsp;</p><p>This is not the only scandal the social media star has recently faced. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did LilHuddy cheat on Charli D'Amelio with other girls?</h2><p>Chase was recently rumored to be cheating on his then-girlfriend Charli.

"It hurts me to say this, but we’ve decided that this is what’s best for both of us."&nbsp;</p><p>The teen "IT" girl continued, "We are still close friends and I would not change that for anything! I truly have so much love for Chase and wish him nothing but the best for him. It makes me happy to see all of the great things he has going for him. I’m sorry I waited so long to tell you all. I wanted to take the time to process it for myself. Breakups are tough for anyone, so I’d really rather not talk about it anymore.” &nbsp;</p><p>Well, the Hype House just got awkward...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWiv8Rmn66co6S7bq7RqKKepl2jvLSx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keith-lee.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Keith Lee</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./candace-marie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Candace Marie- Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
