Delvey joked that she didn't really have a choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The group chatted with everyone and was overall in good spirits. Delvey came and went a few times — once going to get a La Croix for herself ("pure" flavor, for those wondering) — but was always happy to come back and take pictures with everyone hanging out.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Anna Delvey speaks to press on her rooftop.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hedy Phillips</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately for us all, two N.Y.P.D. showed up just before 10 p.m. and asked everyone to vacate the rooftop. Ever the hostess, Delvey welcomed those still in attendance to join her in her apartment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We all quickly realized, though, that the space was small and the air conditioning was not on, and thus, the party ended and several people called it a night.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2023-09-12t005300000z></span><h2 id=mntl-blogpost__headline_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-blogpost__headline mntl-text-block"></h2><p>Of Course It's Custom</p><p>September 11, 2023 08:53 PM EDT</p>Copy The Link To This Blog Post<p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You wouldn't expect Anna Delvey to wear something off the rack, would you?

We have yet to see her make an appearance, though she did FaceTime the models on the bus ride over. The show was scheduled to start 35 minutes ago. At least the rain has stopped!<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bus full of models pulled up to a crowd of people outside Delvey’s apartment ready and waiting to see and be seen. There were plenty of camera flashes and screams for people expecting to see ... someone step off that bus. Trying to make it through the crowd and in the front door was an adventure in itself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now we wait for Delvey.

Kelly Cutrone just told them all that the show may happen live on the street instead of on the rooftop because of the weather. It’ll be decided once they arrive. The streets of New York City might just get to be front row for the hottest show of Fashion Week this season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cutrone also just let the models know that the theme is outlaws — just like the agency — and the theme music of the night will be from the Sopranos.

That’s the contingency plan as of right now. One model told PEOPLE that the rain would add to “the vibes,” while others were less enthusiastic.

The models got their makeup done by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kabuki</a> — who's worked with the likes of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Rihanna</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Lady Gaga </a>— and their hair done by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Ted Gibson</a> — who has had his fingers in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Angelina Jolie</a>'s tresses and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>Priyanka Chopra Jonas</a>' locks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The theme for the night is outlaws — much like Cutrone and Delvey's agency. Think sleek hair and geographic eye looks. The models got ready at an offsite location — minus Delvey — and were shuttled over to her apartment for showtime.</p><a href=# rel=nocaes id=liveblog-refresh__link_1-0 class="liveblog-refresh__link mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><span class=link__wrapper>Refresh for New Updates</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Gju6J5w56jr52pYrimuMuyZJytpKe8r7GMrJ%2Bap12jxqfDjKyfqK9dm8KtuIyrnJyZoGKEeoKXaWhx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dana-fuchs-19760110-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dana Fuchs (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-matravers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Matravers Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
