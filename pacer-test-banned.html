Some of us excel in math and struggle in English. Others really do well in art class but have trouble grasping the concepts in geography. And some people struggle at gym while for others, it's their favorite class. Gym class can be fun when the teacher allows us to play tag or baseball, but when it comes time to do the fitness tests, they can be brutal. They're rough, but if you've heard the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>pacer test is banned</strong></a> going forward, we have some news: That was just a hoax.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the Pacer Test?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FitnessGram</a>, the Pacer Test (sometimes called the "Beep Test" is described as "a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues." The test is used to check and measure the "aerobic capacity" of students to assess how fit they are. And it sounds about as fun as any fitness test would.&nbsp;</p><p>"Students run back and forth as many times as they can, each lap signaled by a beep sound," the site explained. "The test get progressively faster as it continues until the student reaches their max lap score."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>The test is common in the United States, according to FitnessGram. They wrote, "For nearly three decades, the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER) Test has been used as part of the FitnessGram assessment in thousands of P.E. classes in all 50 states."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's not exactly a widely liked test. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one Twitter user</a> succinently put it, "I‚Äôm 25 and still feel victimized by the pacer test from middle school." We couldn't agree more. However, it's likely the hatred of the test that led to the rumor spreading far and wide claiming that the Pacer Test was banned from schools, citing it's been ruled "child cruelty."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was the Pacer Test banned?</h2><p>While there is an element of wishful thinking that the Pacer Test was banned, there have been several instances of this story picking up interest on social media again.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The pacer test got banned for "child cruelty"...hell nah these kids need to feel the pain we went through.</p>‚Äî aspy. üçï (@aspenshae) <a href=#>March 2, 2016</a></figure><p>Tweets similar to this date back to 2016, so people have believed this for a long time, but it turns out this whole Pacer Test being banned is a giant hoax. Sorry folks.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where did the Pacer Test being banned hoax come from?</h2><p>Sorry for the people who have to do the Pacer Test, but the rumor that it's been banned for child cruelty is wrong. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hoax stems from an article</a> that was published on the humor site, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Neomongolia News Network</a>. The fictional article claimed the Pacer Test was banned from all the schools in "Neomongolia" by executive order of "President Chinkus."&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, none of those details are of real places or people. So to all the kids out there who were hoping that they would never again be subjected to that torment, we're truly sorry. Hey, at least it's better than the mile run ... maybe?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6ksdFmq56rpGKvorrNnps%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ix0265qugkasxqi0l52hgizi7lase6pi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Ridiculousness Season 8 Episode 27: Jerry Springer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./worst-place-uk-luton.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>I'm trapped living in 'UK's worst place' - teens stalk streets with machetes &amp;amp; police helicopters ke</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
