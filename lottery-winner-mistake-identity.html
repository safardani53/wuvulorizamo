$758million only to realize she’d have to pay $144million back after breaking a relatively unknown rule.</p><p>The prized <a href=#>ticket</a> was purchased by 53-year-old Mavis Wanczyk in <a href=#>Massachusetts</a> in 2017, but after <a href=#>taxes</a>, she will have around a fourth of her winnings taken away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/758-7-million-jackpot-massachusetts-810930300.jpg><p>During the <a href=#>Powerball</a> drawing, 10million more tickets won prizes worth more than $135million.</p><p>But Wanczyk had especially good fortune, matching all six numbers drawn.</p><p>The odds of winning were set at one in 292.2million.</p><h2>BIG MISTAKE</h2><p>Despite her huge earnings, <a href=#>lottery</a> experts believe Wanczyk made a key mistake by coming forward and revealing her identity.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about the lottery">Read more about the lottery</h2><p>Massachusetts state law requires all lottery winners to be made public.&nbsp;</p><p>However, past winners have been able to create a trust with a trustee to accept the winnings on their behalf.</p><p>The state also permits lottery winners to wait a full year before collecting their earnings.</p><p>By not protecting her identity, Wanczyck put herself in the spotlight, creating additional risks as tons of money-seekers will inevitably reach out, experts say.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>“Her life will be much easier if she can hide behind someone else, so to speak, when she gets all these calls and questions,” attorney Jason Kurland of Certilman Balin Adler & Hyman told <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC.</a></p><p>Wanczyck also saw less money in her account because of the payment method she chose.</p><p>By choosing the $480.5million lump sum cash amount, she’ll inevitably see far less than she would have had she chosen the 30 payments program over the span of 29 years.</p><p>And because of income <a href=#>taxes</a>, the lucky lottery winner likely only got around $336million in her bank account.</p><p>That’s because around $120.1million is owed to the federal government, and $24million will go straight to the state of Massachusetts.</p><p>Financial experts recommend lottery winners quickly get a team of financial advisors together to help them protect their newfound wealth.</p><p>Estate planning is essential at this stage, as the money will need to be protected in case the lottery winner passes away.</p><p>“She’s now one of the world’s wealthiest people and she has to start acting like it,” Kurland said.</p><h2>MORE LOTTERY WINNERS</h2><p>It’s quite common for lottery winners to take home a significant portion less than their winning amount would indicate.</p><p>Edwin Castro, another lucky lottery player in California, won a whopping $2.04billion jackpot but only received $628million.</p><p>When he won in 2022, it was the largest Powerball win of all time.</p><p>However, the earnings were much smaller, as 24 percent of the jackpot went to the <a href=#>IRS</a>, a tax expert told <a href=#>Forbes</a>.</p><p>The cash total is about half of the prize, which would bring the total from $2.04billion to $997.6million.</p><p>Then, after deducting the 24 percent to send to the IRS, the total drops to $758.2million.</p><p>And because of tax bracket rules, Castro will owe another 13 percent this month upon filing taxes.</p><p>That brings the total down to just about $628.5 million.</p><p>California law exempts Powerball winnings from taxes, but otherwise, the earnings would have been even smaller.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Another lucky player</a> won $483million but ended up only taking home a fraction of that due to unforeseen costs.</p><p>And one <a href=#>remorseful lottery winner</a> only brought home $4million of a $450million prize and almost immediately wanted his old life back.</p><p class=postsid
