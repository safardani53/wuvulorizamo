Dreaming employs your God-given imagination to reinforce the vision. Both are part of something I believe is absolutely necessary to building the life of a champion, a winner, a person of high character who is consistently at the top of whatever game he or she is in.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“For me, winning isn’t something that happens suddenly on the field when the whistle blows and the crowds roar. Winning is something that builds physically and mentally every day that you train and every night that you dream.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“Do not compare yourself. Find out what God has placed in your ability.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p><strong>4th of 32 Emmitt Smith Quotes</strong></p><p>“We are all born naked into this world, but each of us is fully clothed in potential.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“Demand excellence.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“Always, through my whole life, I’ve had a thirst for knowledge.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“I was actually looking for answers where I kept asking myself – what am I doing?”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“My mom said, ‘Don’t get married. You’re too young. Go out there and experience what life has to offer.’ And I did.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“My father is Emmit, and my grandfather is Emmit, but I wanted something extra so I could separate my Emmitt from the rest of them. Even though on my birth certificate it has one T, I just added the extra T for me.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“One thing I can say about the Dallas Cowboys: They have always had talent around them. They have been one of the most talented football teams in all of football.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“I’m an enigma, an unknown. You can’t really figure out what I’m going to do next. I like it like that.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“I was going through a little bit of turbulence in my career. And so, it’s funny how turbulence itself will make you hold onto something for security. And so the only thing I knew is trust in the Lord and lean not unto your own heart, in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p><strong>13th of 32 Emmitt Smith Quotes</strong></p><p>“Consistency is one of the hallmarks of my career. You knew what you were going to get out of E-Smith every game, every year, no matter if I was 22, 21 or 35 years old.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“There’s a lot of dancing in football. You can see Victor Cruz doing a little bit of a cha-cha or samba move in the end zone. You can see <a href=#>Terrell Owens</a> getting his popcorn ready. You can see Ochocinco doing the riverdance. But not so much when it comes to ballroom.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“It’s been a tremendous ride. My 15 years, my 15 minutes of fame, is up.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“I’ve given everything I can possible to the game, on and off the field.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“If you’re not settled spiritually, things can be a little bit more chaotic than normal.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“I’ve learned that football sometimes was an outlet. It was a way for me to release anger, release frustration.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“Sixteen games, to me, is a long enough schedule for anybody. We’re already concerning ourselves with head injuries and bodily harm to all of the professional athletes. Add to extra games to it, (and) you are just increasing those risks.”― Emmitt Smith</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emmitt-Smith-with-his-family.jpg><p>“I know how important it is to have your quarterback standing upright. Matter of fact, I know how important it is not to allow someone hit on him period because I want him to think that this pocket is completely safe, no one is going to get to me and I got all the time in the world to make whatever decisions I need to make.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“I used to send Tony Romo texts throughout the season just to encourage him, just to wish him luck and just to tell him to get on his offensive line. I hated watching this young man get sacked as much as he did, especially when it came down to big games.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p><strong><a href=#>97 Motivating Sugar Ray Leonard Quotes</a></strong></p><p>“I used to imagine what it would be like to do what Jim Brown was doing.

I was imagining Emmitt Smith doing exactly what they were doing.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“I have been a Cowboys fan since I was a little bitty boy. And my dream has finally become a reality, of not only just playing a professional, becoming a professional athlete, but playing for the team that I always wanted to play for.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“I enjoyed being a teammate of <a href=#>Deion Sanders</a>.

I don’t have to be out there in August in 108 degree weather down in Texas.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“I have achieved everything that I ever wanted to accomplish in this game and more so, for me, I have been fulfilled.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p><strong><a href=#>100 famous Quotes by Shannon Sharpe</a></strong></p><p>“If I didn’t have a scholarship to go to the University of Florida or any school, I probably would have considered the military because my family could not afford to send me to college.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“If you know anything about me, I’ve never been a trash-talker. That’s not even part of my DNA.”― Emmitt Smith</p><p>“As a former football player who has carried a football more than 4,000 times, trust me, I did not go into ballroom dancing with my body being 100 percent, with no aches or pains or ailments coming with me.
