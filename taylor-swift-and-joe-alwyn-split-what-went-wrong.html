Joe is very shy and never liked all of the attention that came with dating one of the most popular singers in the world,” the insider shares, noting that the “Shake It Off” singer, 33, isn’t at “fault” for the breakup and that the Conversations With Friends star, 32, never “blamed” her for her popularity.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“He just didn’t like having to be on all of the time,” the source explains.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Swift and Alwyn <a href=#>were first linked in May 2017</a>,&nbsp;though&nbsp;fans have speculated that the twosome met<b>&nbsp;</b>at&nbsp;the <a href=#>Met Gala</a> the year prior. Their romance&nbsp;sparked during a time when the Evermore artist was facing scrutiny following her split from <a href=#><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong></a> and amid her public feud with <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Kanye West</strong></a>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Taylor-Swifts-Fame-Contributed-to-Split-From-Joe-Alwyn.jpg><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I felt alone, I felt really bitter,” Swift said <a href=#>in her 2020 Netflix documentary, Ms. Americana</a>. “I felt sort of like a wounded animal lashing out. I figured I had to reset everything. I had to reconstruct an entire belief system for my own personal sanity. I also was falling in love with someone who had a wonderfully normal, balanced life.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Swift added that the pair made a conscious effort at the time to keep their romance under wraps for as long as possible.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“We decided together we wanted our relationship to be private,” she said. “Even though<a href=#> it was [a] really horrible [time]</a>, I was happy. But I wasn’t happy in the way I was trained to be happy. It was happiness without anyone else’s input. We were just … happy.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In October 2017, a source exclusively told Us that duo were <a href=#>“taking it slow” but “very much in love”</a> — and were enjoying the normalcy of a low-key lifestyle.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“It’s very normal, and no one really knows about it right now,” the insider said at the time. “They just work out, watch movies together and invite friends over. Taylor loves to cook and bake for him.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>After more than three years together, another source told</span><i class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</i><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Us</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;that Swift thought of her beau as “one of the only safe constants in her life.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While the insider shared that the former couple had “talked about future and marriage,” they noted that there was no “set deadline in place.” When Swift released her 10th&nbsp;studio album, <a href=#>Midnights</a>, in October 2022, she seemingly hinted at facing public pressure to reach the next major relationship milestone <a href=#>while discussing her single “Lavender Haze.”</a></span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Theoretically, when you’re in the lavender haze, you’ll do anything to stay there and not let you people bring you down off of that cloud. And I think a lot of people have to deal with this now, not just ‘public figures’ because we live in the era of social media and if the world finds out you’re in love with somebody, they’re going to weigh in on it,” she said<a href=#> in a Republic Records clip</a> ahead of the album’s release. “My relationship for six years, we’ve had to doge weird rumors … and we just ignore it. And so this song is about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/All-Easter-Eggs-From-Taylor-Swifts-New-Album-Midnights-001.jpg><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Writing about Alwyn is something Swift has been doing since 2017’s Reputation —&nbsp;and&nbsp;continued throughout her next four records:&nbsp;Lover, Folklore, Evermore and Midnights — with the England native even co-writing several tracks for the albums under the pseudonym William Bowery.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Joe and I really love sad songs. We’ve always bonded over music. … We write the saddest. We just really love sad songs. What can I say?” Swift told&nbsp;<strong>Zane Lowe</strong>&nbsp;on his Apple Music show in December 2022. “And I say it was a surprise that we started writing together, but in a way, it wasn’t because we have always bonded over music and had the same musical tastes. And he’s always the person who’s showing me songs by artists and then they become my favorite songs.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>When Swift won <a href=#>Album of the Year at the 2021 Grammy’s for Folklore</a>, the Mary Queen of Scots actor was one of the first people she thanked.<b>&nbsp;</b>“[Joe], he is the first person who I play every new song I write,” Swift gushed during her acceptance speech. “And I had the best time writing songs with you in quarantine.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While the two have often communicated about their love through song, speaking publicly about their relationship has been something they have both have avoided, particularly Alwyn.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I’m aware people want to know about that side of things. I think we have been successfully very private and that has now sunk in for people,” the Harriet star<b class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</b>said in the October 2018 issue of&nbsp;</span><a href=#><span class=x_ContentPasted0>British Vogue</span></a><i class=x_ContentPasted0>.<span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></i><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“But I really prefer to talk about work.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In April 2022, he further opened up to <a href=#>Elle</a> about his reasoning for being so “guided and private” when it comes to his life <a href=#>with the “Anti-Hero” songstress</a>.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“It’s<a href=#> more a response to something else</a>,” he said. “We live in a culture that is so increasingly intrusive. The more you give and frankly, even if you don’t give it, something will be taken.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The following month, Alwyn addressed rumors that he had proposed to the Pennsylvania native — and once again reinstated that he&nbsp;prefered&nbsp;to keep his relationship out of the spotlight.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“If I had a pound for every time I think I’ve been told I’ve been engaged, then I’d have a lot of pound coins,” Alwyn joked to<a href=#> WSJ. Magazine </a>at the time.&nbsp;“I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn’t say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn’t say.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Us confirmed on April 9 <a href=#>that the duo had called it quits</a>, but neither Swift nor Alwyn have commented on the breakup.&nbsp;However,</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;the “Bejeweled” singer</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;— who is currently on her Eras tour — may have hinted at the split during her March 31 concert in Arlington, Texas, when she swapped the song “Invisible String” for&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“The 1″ on her setlist.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While “Invisible String” details how she fell in love with the Boy Erased actor, “The 1” discusses the end of a relationship between two people <a href=#>who wished they were right for each other</a>.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0> Swift was also seen tearing up during her performance of “Champagne Problems,” which reveals a marriage proposal gone wrong.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdlrulecmonGaZnKzGr3nSqaOirF2staLAjLCcp6xdrL%2BwusZo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vibhor-parashar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vibhor Parashar- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pic-rosario-dawson-gropes-paul-rudds-package-2011282.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>PIC: Rosario Dawson Gropes Paul Rudd's Package!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
