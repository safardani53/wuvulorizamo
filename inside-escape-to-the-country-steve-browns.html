I know that everyone has different family set-ups. I'm very happy and lucky with what I've got. I don't take it for granted - my family are all very close," he told Express Online.</p><p>He added: "It won't be the first time they've helped me out. We go as a family to the beach or wherever.</p><p>"They'll grab my chair and pull me across the stones and that sort of thing.&nbsp;And what is great is because<strong> </strong>we are close and they help me quite a lot, they know where my limitations are."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>The TV presenter rarely talks about his private life, but he has opened up about the accident that left him using a wheelchair.</p><p>"The environment around me was all still. I was looking up and there wasn't any noise or movement. The trees were still. It was almost as if me lying there was reflecting&nbsp;the&nbsp;environment I was in.</p><p>He continued: "Everything was so still and quiet, including my body," in an interview with Disability Horizon's.</p><p>The TV presenter said he was taken to hospital and the doctors saved his life that night. He then recalled "I started being told a little bit about what happened."</p><p>He shared: "Because my injury was C6-C7 incomplete, they didn't know how much better it might get and the last thing they were going to do was turn around and say, right, you are going to be in a wheelchair forever.</p><p>Steve said it took a long time for him to accept that he would become a wheelchair user.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Steve Brown">Read more on Steve Brown</h2><p>Despite his disability, Steve was still determined to not let it stop him from living his life.</p><p>After a long recovery he went on to join the Great Britain rugby squad before becoming the captain of the team for the Paralympic games in 2012.</p><p>The former Olympian inspired viewers at home when he completed a climb of Pen Y Fan in aid of Countryfile's Children In Need Ramble along with his two brothers back in November 2019.</p><p>The TV presenter found love with <a href=#>Alton Tower's crash victim</a>, Vicky Balch. The pair met when they both took part in BBC1's Without Limits documentary, which saw them drive 900 miles across Vietnam. Although the pair were "smitten" they announced their split later that year in 2017.</p><p>Steve appeared in the latest episode of Escape to the Country - which saw the TV presenter show a selection of striking homes to a young water-loving couple who were looking to purchase a home in Cornwall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Vicky-Balch-and-Steve-Brown-in-Without-Limits.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SNT01NOV06Ajpg-JS615826793.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun Showbiz team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlpbIJ3fZFvZqKmo56xpnnErJqaqJViwbB506GcZpufqru1vthmqq2dppp6o77OsKWsZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./most-expensive-celebrity-engagement-rings-of-all-time-pics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Most Expensive Celebrity Engagement Rings of All Time: Pics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-chelsea-afc-wimbledon-on-tv-live-stream-carabao-cup.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chelsea 2-1 AFC Wimbledon LIVE RESULT: Enzo Fernandez fires Blues to epic Carabao Cup clash win afte</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
