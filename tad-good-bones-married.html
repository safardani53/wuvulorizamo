In the show's final episode, which aired on Oct. 17, 2023, <a href=#>Mina Starsiak Hawk</a> helped her half-brother renovate his and Anna's dream home. When it came time for Anna to tour the completed house, Tad popped the question in their brand-new kitchen.</p><p>"I think this is going to be your favorite spot, if you come over here," Tad told Anna, signaling for her to join him at the kitchen island. He then dropped down on one knee and asked Anna to marry him.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Baby, I love you with all my heart," Tad sweetly said. "And I don't know what I did to deserve you, but I thank God for you every single day. You're my absolute best friend and my dearest companion."</p><p>"Will you marry me?" Tad asked Anna as she nodded her head, evidently overcome with emotion. The newly engaged pair embraced before Tad's family arrived and welcomed Anna to the family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"She is my person," Tad later said of Anna in a separate interview. "She is my best friend. She's my dearest friend. It's like all this cliche stuff, but it's very accurate. It's very real. And I'm really glad I put a ring on it."</p><p>Once again, congratulations to the happy couple — we wish Tad and Anna nothing but endless love and happiness!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa6lecaopp1lkqS7pr%2BMppirqpmasQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./phil-vassar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Phil Vassar</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eva-notty.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eva Notty</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
