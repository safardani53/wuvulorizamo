deposit checks, pay bills, and send or receive money.</p><p>There is a monthly fee of $5, but it can be waived with a direct deposit or monthly deposits totaling at least $500.</p><p>This is a popular option as Walmart holds 18.7 percent of the market share for checking accounts.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><h2>2. <strong>PREPAID DEBIT CARDS</strong></h2><p>Walmart also offers a few reloadable debit cards, including the Walmart MoneyCard.</p><p>The best feature of this card is the cashback worth up to $75 a year, giving you three percent at Walmart.com, two percent at Walmart fuel stations, and one percent at Walmart stores.</p><p>There is a $5.94 monthly fee, but again, you can waive this by depositing $500 or more onto the card each month.</p><p>Walmart has also partnered with Green Dot to offer two other debit cards.</p><p>The Visa Debit can get you your pay up to two days early, and comes with no monthly fees as long as you deposit $500 or more.</p><p>On the other hand, the PayAsYouGo card has zero fees - you can just reload this and pay per use.</p><h2>3. <strong>CREDIT CARDS</strong></h2><p>Walmart only offers one credit card right now, but it has a lot of benefits for loyal shoppers.</p><p>With the Capital One® Walmart Rewards® Card, you can earn five percent cashback on Walmart.com, including pickup and delivery.</p><p>You’ll also get two percent cashback at Walmart stores and fuel stations, at restaurants, and on travel.</p><p>For everything else, the cashback rate is one percent.</p><h2>4. <strong>BILL PAY SERVICES</strong></h2><p>If you need to pay your utilities, insurance, car payment, or a variety of other bills, MoneyCenter offers bill payment services to over 20,000 organizations.</p><p>This is powered by CheckFreePay, MoneyGram, and Western Union.</p><p>Fees for this service vary by biller and delivery speed.</p><h2>5. <strong>MONEY TRANSFERS</strong></h2><p>You can send money anywhere in the U.S. or to over 200 countries in-store.</p><p>This service is powered by Ria, Western Union, and MoneyGram.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if you are sending money to friends and family within the U.S., you may find services such as Venmo, CashApp, or Zelle, to have lower fees.</p><h2>6. <strong>CHECK CASHING</strong></h2><p>You can take your checks to get instant cash or get the money loaded onto your Walmart MoneyCard.</p><p>The fees for this service vary with a max fee of $4 for checks up to $1,000 and $8 for checks greater than $1,000.</p><h2>7. <strong>TAX ASSISTANCE</strong></h2><p>If you still haven’t filed your tax return for 2023, this could be a perfect option.</p><p>MoneyCenter offers tax services via Jackson Hewitt.</p><p>You can set up an in-store appointment with a tax professional just like you would at other providers.</p><h2><strong>WHY WALMART?</strong></h2><p>Walmart banking services might be preferable for those who cannot access a regular bank account.</p><p>While the fees for its services can be high, MoneyCenter is more likely to approve those with an adverse financial history.</p><p>Others may simply like MoneyCenter for the convenience of being located inside a Walmart store.</p><p>But you can also access many of the services online or through the service provider’s mobile apps.</p><p>Bear in mind, Walmart is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).</p><p>However, some of its products are insured through partner banks, such as the Walmart MoneyCard and GO2bank checking accounts.</p><p>It’s important to read the terms and conditions before applying for any financial product.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>If you’re a Wells Fargo customer, this bank is <a href=#>offering a new feature</a> to help users make and monitor financial goals.</p><p>Also, see&nbsp;<a href=#>a list of major banks</a>&nbsp;that let you get paid two days earlier.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIJ3gY9wa2ivkaG6or7TZqSoppWueqSxza2cq2WSlrustc2gZKydoqu2pLHSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./c96p4amayzzgg-apombj1ozbvf-pvpqr.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Rocko's Modern Life Season 2 Episode 1: I Have No Son</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-virzi-umy7-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Virzi (Comedian) -
