What goes on in Rockfield stays in Rockfield.”</p><p>Until now, that is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/67566771-9b56-4af9-9d95-ec129e06fdf9.jpg><p>The brothers knew “nothing” about the music business when they started out as a band called the Charles Kingsley Creation in the 1960s.</p><p>So much so that they brought their own reel to reel tape machine to play their demo at EMI because “we never imagined that EMI would have their own tape players” and thought Beatles producer George Martin was a comedian.</p><p>They built their own studio in the loft of the barn in 1965 using empty pig feed bags to insulate the walls and started charging other bands a fiver to record demos.</p><p>Dave Edmunds, who laid down his 1970 hit I Hear You Knocking there, suggested they called the studio Rockfield after the neighbouring village.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594572474.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/a56ced85-76dd-4430-8d07-9e4cfe173ab9.jpg><p>And they became a residential studio by accident, when a New York band Elephant’s Memory stayed at the brother’s parent’s house because the group had no other digs.</p><p>Back then there weren’t any big independent recording studios and Kingsley says “people were saying we would never make it outside of London, but then low and behold Black Sabbath turned up, who I had never heard of, and we started recording these big rock bands.”</p><h2>'All doing drugs'</h2><p>From the outside the farmhouse looks like a picture of serenity with its white picket fences, neatly trimmed hedgerows and cows chewing the green grass of the Welsh mountains.</p><p>It certainly wasn’t what Birmingham metal act Black Sabbath were expecting from their first experience of recording an album.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/65dc6591-48d4-4ad9-833a-6ab6581fbf43.jpg><p>Sabbath lead singer Ozzy Osbourne had never been to the countryside before, but loved the chance to build a raft to row on the river and take loads of illegal substances.</p><p>Ozzy, who also recorded his first solo album there, said: "We were all drinking or doing some drugs."</p><p>The band most associated with Rockfield, though, are Queen, because the studio appears in the hit movie Bohemian Rhapsody.</p><p>Both their classic albums Sheer Heart Attack and Night at The Opera were made there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000448667926.jpg><p>Freddie Mercury recorded the piano section of the Bohemian Rhapsody song while the rest of the band played frisbee in the courtyard.</p><p>Kingsley said: “After the film came out, we had a lot of Japanese turn up here. They get very emotional.”</p><h2>Boozy Bowie and Lemmy's stash</h2><p>Soon all kinds of legends were turning up.</p><p>When Iggy Pop was making an album, his friend David Bowie did some back vocals.</p><p>The pair decided to pop to see what a then 17-year-old Jim Kerr from Simple Minds was up to in the smaller studio.</p><p>Singer Kerr recalled: “Bowie was wearing a red suit, had a huge piece of cheese in his hand a can of Heineken."</p><p>Lemmy recorded there with both Hawkwind and Motorhead, asking Kingsley where he could hide his “stash” of weed when he first arrived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594572704.jpg><p>The reputation of Rockfield’s guests, who would go drinking in nearby Monmouth, soon spread to the local constabulary.</p><p>A drug squad car was posted at the end of the driveway to watch what the various long haired rockers were up to.</p><p>While Kingsley was cleaning up one day in 1972 officers raided the studios and found marijuana.</p><p>Kingsley explained: “We were never into drugs ourselves. But a band from America had been smoking dope all week.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594517200-1.jpg><p>He was charged with allowing illegal substances to be consumed on his premises, but the judge threw the case out of court on the grounds that if Kingsley was guilty so would any hotel owner be if their guests left drugs behind.</p><h2>Britpop Breakthrough</h2><p>Bands would play football among the cows in the meadow or take rides in the small aeroplanes on the farm’s own airstrip.</p><p>Meanwhile Kingsley and Charles drove around in their tractors and tended to the animals.</p><p>The brothers grew wealthy, with Kingsley sending his two daughters to private school and buying a BMW.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594572476.jpg><p>But when electronic music arrived in the 1980s, the work dried up and his wife Ann, 80, had to take on several accounting jobs to make ends meet.</p><p>Like so many famous duos the brothers split, with Charles setting up his Monnow Valley studio next door, while Kingsley continued with Rockfield in 1987.</p><p>They were both to enjoy a revival in the following decade, though, with the arrival of Britpop.</p><p>Oasis made their debut Definitely, Maybe at Monnow and their follow-up What’s the Story at Rockfield.</p><p>The band’s lead singer Liam Gallagher describes Rockfield as “like the Big Brother house, except with tunes,” although admits he struggles to remember much because the group were “so off our heads.”</p><h2>Cricket bat bust ups</h2><p>It was Liam getting drunk and bringing party goers back late at night while his brother Noel was still in work mode that caused one of their biggest ever rows.</p><p>Liam laughed: “We got into a fight with cricket bats and air rifles. I remember Noel driving off. I flung a dustbin lid as he drove off.”</p><p>Another time Liam claims he took a joy ride in a Combine Harvester.</p><p>Kingsley, though, describes Oasis as “lovely lads” and says they were “sheepish” when Ann had to tell them off late at night for waking the neighbourhood up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594572471.jpg><p>No band resided so long at Rockfield as The Stone Roses, who were spent more than two years there making their two albums.</p><p>The Manchester band once turned up covered in paint having thrown it on a record label exec's car and were arrested at the farm the next day.</p><h2>High-speed horror smash</h2><p>A heavy drinking culture was to have tragic consequences for The Charlatans when they were staying at Rockfield in 1996.</p><p>After a night on the booze in Monmouth, their keyboard player Rob Collins drove at high speeds round the tight country lanes on the way back to the studio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596274064.jpg><p>Singer Tim Burgess, who was in a car in front, remembered: “He was speeding up, being crazy. Suddenly he disappeared.”</p><p>Collins’s car had flipped over on a bend and he was thrown through the sunroof of his BMW. He was dead before he reached hospital.</p><p>There is no doubt, though, the Wye valley setting has been an inspiration to the songwriters who have enjoyed its tranquillity.</p><h2>Musical Hogwarts</h2><p>Coldplay singer Chris Martin was feeling the pressure to come up with a hit for their debut album.</p><p>Having struggled to deliver at a London studio, the band decamped to Rockfield, which Martin describes as a “musical Hogwarts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594572682.jpg><p>One night they stepped outside into the “beautiful” night and the producer Ken Nelson said “look at the stars.”</p><p>The line stuck in Martin’s head and added the “it was all yellow” line to their famous song Yellow when he saw a copy of the Yellow Pages on the studio shelf.</p><p>Charles retired in 2000, but Kingsley still runs Rockfield with his daughters Lisa, 52, and Amanda, 51.</p><p>While they were once so busy that they had to turn down Michael Jackson, the family have now had to diversify into holiday lettings to make up for a loss in trade.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE IN TV & SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p>Despite that, the studio is known around the world.</p><p>But modest Kingsley doesn’t want to take the credit for its legendary status.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He concludes: “It was the groups that made Rockfield”.</p><p><strong>Rockfield: The Studio On The Farm airs on July 18 on BBC Four, BBC Wales and BBC iPlayer.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpYmaBeYGTamarp5Ogs6qxy51krKylmbawv4yfmKulXayurbHSZpmbm12ZvKTBzJ6lrZmirnqwrdKiqmaanJawrHnSmpmbmaSdeqO71qKcaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lala-kent-new-ink-change-rand-tattoo-split-randall.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lala Kent gets new ink to change 'Rand' tattoo after split from fiance Randall Emmett amid cheating</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./floyd-abrams.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Floyd Abrams</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
