They weren’t just roommates. They were lifelong partners who had built a life for themselves in Chicago, Illinois. Their romance inspired Terry’s great-nephew <strong>Chris Bolan</strong> to film them as part of the documentary, A Secret Love, which is being released on Netflix on April 29, 2020. But, apart from being one-half of a devoted couple, Terry was also a former female pro baseball player who spent some of the 1940s entertaining Americans just like the women featured in the 1992 film, A League of Their Own. Here’s what you need to know about the late sports star:</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. She played for the Peoria Redwings as a solid receiver from 1946 to 1949, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>All-American Girls Professional Baseball League’s website</a>.</strong> Terry, who was born in Saskatchewan, Canada on Aug. 22, 1925, knew the special place her story held in the hearts of fans. “When people know that you played in the All-American and A League of Their Own, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the movie</a>, they get so excited and then if you give them a card it just blows them away,” she said in A Secret Love. “It’s so funny that little card has made so many people happy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2. She met her future wife Pat Henschel in 1947.</strong> “It was one of the best days of my life when I met her on that Sunday morning in the hockey rink…” Pat, a fellow Canadian, said in the Netflix doc. Pat was 18 at the time to Terry’s 22. The couple eventually moved to Chicago in the U.S. where they lived as roommates. “We thought it would be easier to be ourselves,” Pat said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/a-secret-love-2-embed.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/a-secret-love-2-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>3. They kept their romance a secret for decades.</strong> Illinois was the first state in the U.S. to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>decriminalize homosexuality</a>, but that wasn’t until 1961. Up until that point Pat and Terry’s relationship was illegal. Even after that milestone they still kept the true nature of their relationship a secret until 2009, when Terry came out to her niece <strong>Diana Bolan</strong>. “Since that day it seemed like a great big thing had been lifted off my shoulders,” she said in the doc.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>4. Pat and Terry <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>finally married</a> in 2015.</strong> By then they were living in an assisted living facility in Illinois. They wed in front of family and friends on Terry’s 90th birthday.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>5. Terry died of Parkinson’s Disease in March 2019.</strong> She was 93. At the time of her death, she and Pat (who is now 91) had been together for 71 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LBpr7RsmSdp56WtbaxjJpkrJ2Tp7K1ecuorZ5llKSwboCPbGlvbGhk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emporio-armani-skinny-models-runway-pictures-spring-2015-milan-fashion-week.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>[PICS] Emporio Armani Skinny Models Spring 2015 Milan Fashion Week Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-matthew-oleary-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Matthew O'Leary Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
