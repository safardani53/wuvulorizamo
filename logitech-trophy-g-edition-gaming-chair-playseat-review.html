It's relatively simple but not as straightforward nor as elegant as a click.</p><p>Luckily enough, you won't resort to it too frequently as it's not designed to offer different inclinations depending on the racing discipline, but more on the person sitting.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Gaming</h2></p><p>Velcro straps, somewhat of a Playseat trademark, are practical to adjust the seat on the fly, but don't necessarily expect it to look like in the promotional photos in terms of end results.</p><p>Since it's not folding, we'd expect a fixed seat as a selling point of the setup, if only because of the £529 pricing.</p><p>For those coming from a Thrustmaster ecosystem – read our <a href=#>T818 review</a> for more – compatibility can be a bit of an issue.&nbsp;</p><p>The platform you put the steering wheel on has lots of screw holes, but apparently not for non-Logitech steering wheels.&nbsp;</p><p>That's why we had to use desk hooks and apply shims, otherwise the hooks wouldn't be tall enough to hold both the wheel and the platform.</p><p>As for the pedals, it's only slightly better. Only two of the four screws were compatible, though this was enough to hold them up.</p><p>Of course, it should be noted that the setup is designed for the Logitech ecosystem, so take all this more as a PSA than for actual criticism.</p><p>If you don't own a Logitech wheel, be prepared for some minor – albeit acceptable – compromises.</p><p>We were expecting the seat to be more reclinable, but even adopting the final length, we're sitting like in a street car.</p><p>On the one hand, it's comfortable – more so than in the folding Playseat Challenge Black – as we don't struggle to get back up and out of it.</p><p>On the other, it's a little tight on your arms, and this could be tiring in longer sessions.</p><p>The ActiFit cloth seems to get dirty too easily, but apart from some wrinkling due to the straps, it's pretty classy.</p><p>The breathable ActiFit material keeps it cool and comfortable to use even for longer sessions, and on a positive note, you never end up sinking it - always remaining firm in your starting sit.&nbsp;</p><p>The body-conforming design and headrest are especially comfortable, and support you with great reliability.</p><p>Anyway, the Logitech Trophy G Edition Gaming Chair Playseat is more than just the seat, and maybe it's most distinctive feature is the solid, frameless rig.</p><p>The central axis moving from the steering wheel platform brings in even more sturdiness, and also allows you to rest your feet for a bit.</p><p>Solidity is impressive. You can get up and out of the seat holding the side handles, and unlike foldable editions, you never have a feeling of it possibly overturning.</p><p>However, you can move and store it in a snap, easily sliding it across the floor.</p><p>And for when you're not using it, it's not as long as it might look in photos, otherwise it's compact and elegant.</p><p>All in all, looking at the pricing, there's room for improvement and maybe we expected a little more – more reclinable, more compatibility, and a bit more from the seat.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>However, the Logitech Trophy Playseat G Edition Gaming Chair is a substantial upgrade over foldable systems, and one from which you'll hardly move away.</p><p>Written by Paolo Sirio on behalf of <a href=#>GLHF</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">All the latest Gaming tips and tricks</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-templates-workspace.png><p class=article__content--intro>Looking for tips and tricks across your favourite consoles and games?
