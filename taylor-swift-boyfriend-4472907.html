Their relationship mostly made headlines when they would make a rare comment about one another. In 2020, for instance, Taylor admitted she was “falling in love with someone who had a really wonderfully normal, balanced, grounded life” during her 2020 documentary, Taylor Swift: Miss Americana.&nbsp;She also told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Paul McCartney</strong></a> her and Joe’s secret for<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;maintaining a balanced and quiet life</a> was all about trying to replicate “normalcy” any way they could. “Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture — the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy,” she said in their 2020&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> cover story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taylor-Swift-boyfriend-Joe-Alwyn-embed6.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Taylor named Joe publicly for the first time in her 2020 documentary, Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions.

She then complimented his musical ability. <span>“Joe plays piano beautifully, and he’s always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things,” she explained as she spoke about the song’s creation. “It was pretty obvious that it should be a duet ’cause he’s got such a low voice and it sounded really good sung down there and in that register.” In 2021, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylor thanked Joe</a> when accepting her third Grammy for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Album Of The Year </a>for&nbsp;Folklore and said he’s the first person she plays songs for.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Tom Hiddleston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taylor-Swift-boyfriend-Joe-Alwyn-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>Before getting with Joe, Taylor dated English actor<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Tom Hiddleston </strong></a>for a few months following her split from Calvin Harris. They were first linked when they were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photographed making out</a> on the beach near Taylor’s Rhode Island beach house in June 2016. The pair were not afraid to be seen together, and on July 4, Tom rocked an “I [heart] T.S.” tee, as seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>. That same month, he denied that his and Taylor’s love was for show. “Well, um.

Around their one-year anniversary, Taylor called their romance “magical” while speaking to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue </a>in April 2016. Unfortunately, they broke up a few months later.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Although they seemed to part ways on good terms, things changed when Taylor switched her pseudonym,<strong> Nils Sjoberg</strong>, to her real name on the writing credits for Calvin and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>‘s viral hit, “This Is What You Came For”. He then took to Twitter to air his frustration about the ordeal. “I wrote the music, produced the song, arranged it and cut the vocals, though. And, initially, she wanted it kept secret, hence the pseudonym,” he wrote in a series of since-deleted tweets, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “Hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage, though.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>“I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,” he slammed in another tweet. “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Katy [Perry]</strong></a> ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry.

The song has many parallels to their relationship and Jake’s life, such as their age gap (which was addressed in 2022’s “All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)”) and visiting her love interest’s sister’s house. Jake has a sister named <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Maggie</strong></a>.

He has since won the prize as Taylor’s most disliked boyfriend by her loyal fans due to the way he is reportedly portrayed in her songs about him. For instance, there is a song titled “Dear John” on her 2010 album, Speak Now. In the song, Taylor addressed their 12-year age gap and his supposed wrongdoing by sorrowfully belting, “I see it all now that you’re gone / Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with? / The girl in the dress cried the whole way home”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-29>John himself believes the lyrics are about him and even defended himself against the “humiliating” song in a 2012 interview with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>.&nbsp;“It made me feel terrible.
