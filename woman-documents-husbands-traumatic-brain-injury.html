Despite our differences, there are some stories on social media that bring us all together — one of which is this tragic tale of a wife and mother-of-two.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When two people get married, they vow to have each other’s backs for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health. And <a href=#>TikTok</a> user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@kay.epps</a> and her family were faced with a tragedy that put her <a href=#>wedding vows</a> to the test in 2023.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After Kay’s husband of 15 years, Randy Epps sustained a <a href=#>traumatic brain injury</a> (TBI), she took to TikTok with a cry for help. Since then, she has used the social media platform to document his road to recovery.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman documented her husband’s road to recovery after he sustained a traumatic brain injury.</h2><p>Kay first explained what happened to her husband in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> posted in late May. In the TikTok, Kay explained that her husband, a former Marine, was playing outside with their two boys on Mother’s Day when he had a terrible fall and was rushed to the hospital.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>There, he was diagnosed with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diffuse axonal injury</a> and a broken elbow.

In one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">update</a>, Kay shared the real reason we don’t see her husband in her videos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“One of the things that has been brought up — and I've mentioned it, but I wanted to speak a little more thoroughly about it — is why I don’t put Randy in my videos. The short answer is that he cannot consent to that right now,” Kay clapped back at critics.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kay shared that although Randy has some “very lucid moments,” he’s still not ready to be on camera. “In those moments I have mentioned TikTok and that I’m doing this and he’s OK with it,” she added.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“But to me, if they’re still asking me to consent to things medically, that means he’s not ready to consent to things on his own. And he is in his absolute most vulnerable state. I don’t want to take that dignity away from him.”</p><p>If you needed convincing: Kay and her husband are living proof that love really does heal all wounds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mm6ibpaKyr8DSZp%2Buq5KWu6W%2FjK2pmq2dlsGqr4ybqZqhnmK2r7bUq7A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./donald-trump-daughter-bikini-tiffany-trump-pics-florida.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>[PICS] Donald Trumps Daughter In A Bikini See Photos Of Tiffany Trump Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pdc-world-darts-championship-final-live-results-van-gerwen-smith-stream-start-time-tv-channel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>PDC World Darts Championship final LIVE RESULT: Smith BEATS Van Gerwen to win first world title afte</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
