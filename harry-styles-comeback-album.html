The last thing we want fans to think is that we are divided and hate each other. It’s not like that.</p><p>“Things will come from probably all of us I imagine at some point, in various ways.”</p><p>Brad added: “We are all working on separate things.</p><p>“We’re all into different types of music so it’s nice to explore those different avenues and I actually think that’s going to be really interesting when we come back to writing.”</p><p>The Pollen Weekender will see them play several shows and allow fans to join them for other activities including a cocktail masterclass, brunch and a boat party along with other artists including Dougie Poynter and Sigala.</p><p>But before that they will have to nurse Connor back to full health after he cut his leg while taking part in last week’s Dancing On Ice.</p><p>They aren’t worried about him though.
