I fell into a deep depression eating & drinking every single day. I was at rock bottom."</p><p>Charli then went on to detail her past health struggles and how she overcame her insecurities surrounding her body.</p><p>"Then I got surgery which helped my foot but hurt me mentally & physically.

I’ve forgiven my past & people involved in my past and just want to move forward.”</p><h2><strong>NEW SEASON</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Season nine of the series</a> aired last month and already offered tons of drama after its one-year hiatus due to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Covid-19 pandemic</a>.</p><p>While many of the original ladies returned, there was a shake-up with the cast as <a href=#>Kristen Doute</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Stassi Schroeder</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jax Taylor</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Brittany Cartwright</a> were fired from the show for making <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">racist comments</a>&nbsp;about former cast member Faith Stowers.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Stowers said the police were called on her after her former castmates accused her of a crime she didn’t commit.</p><p>Additional changes were made in the cast including Scheana's partner&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brock Davies</a> and one or two of her babies may be on the show, as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lala Kent</a>’s six-month-old daughter Ocean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000588472037.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000588472030.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000688043231.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>VPR's Lala Kent said she 'wouldn't put it past Randall Emmett to cheat but vowed to never turn a blind eye' before split</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hraG6EcoORaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsBur8eaqaWhXZfCs7rEratmn5Geu6awjG1sZqSSqHqlsc%2BrnKyrmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raquel-leviss-why-the-heck-did-i-return-to-vanderpump-rules.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why the Heck Did I Return to Vanderpump Rules?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fxjl3ajxvse0d9gui7cb9qdj-chjyuk.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
