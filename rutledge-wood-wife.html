Thanks to his years of experience, he has hella credibility when it comes to cars. So much so, that in the past, he’s been tapped by more than a few television networks.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He got his start when he made his debut on History’s Top Gear. Since then, we’ve seen him take on the title of the host on other reality TV competition shows like <a href=#>The American Barbecue Showdown</a>, Floor is Lava, Hyperdrive, and most recently, NBC’s Hot Wheels: Ultimate Challenge.</p><p>But despite his fast-paced career, Rutledge switches gears when he’s with his wife and kids.

Thank you,” he ended the post.</p><p>Rutledge’s job limits the time he’s able to spend with the fam, but at least he’s bringing home the bacon … and a lot of it. So, what’s the TV host’s net worth?
