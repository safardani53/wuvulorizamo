You’re at one of the finest universities in the world. You’re smiling, and you should be, you worked hard for this,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“But even now, after you reached your goal, you’re still not quite sure if you belong and can’t get one question out of your mind: ‘Am I good enough?’ There aren’t many kids here who look like you. Some arrived on campus in limousines. One of your classmates is a bona fide movie star, another is rumored to be a real-life princess. Meanwhile, you got dropped off by your father in the family sedan,” wrote the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Becoming</a> author. “Years from now, you’ll learn that your parents had to take out new credit cards to pay your tuition. But Michelle, what you’ll come to realize one day is that you’re only seeing what you lack and not everything that your story has given you.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michelle Obama/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michelle also paid tribute to her late father Fraser C. Robinson III, who died in March 1991.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Your father’s final lesson will come far too soon. He’ll teach you that life is fleeting. So laugh with him until your side hurts. Savor the grip of his hugs, the softness in his eyes. A day will come when those memories are all you’ll have,” she shared. “His absence will hit you like a rock. It’ll cause you to rethink everything about yourself and your future. But don’t worry, you won’t have to go through any of this alone.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michelle Obama/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she lost one of the most important male figures in her life, Michelle would welcome another man into her heart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You’ll open your heart to someone whose upbringing was nothing and everything like yours, all at the same time. He’s driven by a hopeful set of ideals. He’s grounded and kind and absolutely brilliant. And he’s pretty good looking, too. I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said in reference to husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barack Obama</a>. “His certainty about his path will feel like a challenge to yours. You’ll learn that even the best relationships take work but that’s okay, that’s normal and it’s what gives your partnership its strength.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michelle Obama/Twitter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October, Barack and Michelle, who are proud parents of daughters Sasha and Malia, celebrated their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>26th wedding anniversary</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Together, you’ll be blessed with two perfect little girls who will fill you with so much joy you can barely process it. Yet you’ll still struggle to find a balance between your family, your husband’s rising career, and your own sense of self,” the mother of two said. “Be patient. You’ll get there. And just when you think you’ve done it, the four of you will be shot out of a cannon into the unknown.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After college and creating her own career as a lawyer, Michelle supported her husband and his political career that would eventually take their family to the highest office in the country. But the road to the White House and his presidency would not come without immense scrutiny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Everything you’ve fought for so hard – stability, balance, confidence – will feel like it’s at risk. You’ll be attacked by people who’ve never met you and don’t really care to. They’ll try to harm you for their own gain. Don’t stoop to their level, no matter how gratifying it might feel in the moment,” she wrote. “Hold tight to those values your parents taught you. Your family will make history, breaking barriers and filling out a more complete picture of the American story. You’ll meet two popes and the Queen of England. People will fill stadiums to hear you speak.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Marla Aufmuth/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, Michelle advised her younger self to stay humble.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It will be easy to think you’re something special. Just remember that there are millions of people who grew up like you did and don’t get this kind of spotlight. Reflect the light back on them. There are so many people out there like you, Miche,” she said. “Black girls and minorities of all kinds, working-class kids from big cities and small towns, people who doubt themselves, who are uncertain about whether they belong but have so much to offer the world. Share your story with them, the struggles and the triumphs and everything else. Show them that there’s more beauty inside than they can see right now. That’s how you’ll answer that question that’s following you around, the one that sometimes keeps you up at night.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michelle concluded, “You’re more than enough, Miche. You always have been and you always will be. And I can’t wait for you to see that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CkuarAyJyqaKWZmLWmuMueZKiakaKubrHMqKuip56WuW64xK2rnqpdqbxutMSrZLKnpaO0pr6MrJylnl8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ozzy-osbourne-says-he-works-out-every-day-8418159.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ozzy Osbourne Says He's Been Working Out Every Day</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hollywood-ryan-murphy-netflix-full-nudity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hollywoods Ryan Murphy reveals Netflix revelled in shows full nudity with hundreds s</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
