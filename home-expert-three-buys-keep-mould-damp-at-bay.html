It won't cost you a single penny.</p><p>"The silica gel packet that's included in many everyday products such as a new pair of shoes, electronics, medication or dry food like beef jerky can be put to good use in your home as well," he explains.</p><p>"They were originally designed to prevent moisture that could potentially damage a product.</p><p>"That's why these tiny silica packets are the cheapest way you can absorb moisture at home."</p><p>However, he warns: "Be cautious if you have children or pets though, as these are incredibly harmful if ingested."</p><p>Next, the property expert recommends the 'Meaco 12L Low Energy Dehumidifier.'</p><p>"Not only is this dehumidifier a fantastic way to reduce moisture and prevent mould at home, but it's also an excellent energy-saving option," he points out.</p><p>"Bearing in mind that the UK is currently seeing what can be described as the worst energy crisis, it has become a priority for most people to try and reduce their energy consumption too."</p><p>Finally, the property whizz suggests purchasing the £14 'Ansio Interior Dehumidifier.'</p><p>"It's the easiest way you can prevent damp in your home," he says. "You can simply place it in all humid areas of your home, close to windows, in the bathroom or around laundry.</p><p>The silica gel packet that's included in<br>many everyday products such as a new pair of shoes, electronics, medication or dry food like beef jerky can be put to good use in your home as well</p><span class=quote-credit>Simon Boden</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>Home expert</span><p>"It'll use its specifically formulated hydrophilic crystals<br>to draw and retain moisture from the air."</p><p>Simon continues: "This also helps in fighting mould, mildew as well as neutralising unpleasant odours.</p><p>"Because of its natural process that doesn’t require an energy source, it makes for the easiest, quietest and cheapest option on the market.</p><p>Discussing the different types of dehumidifers on offer, Simon concludes: "The absorption dehumidifiers use a desiccant to remove water from the air, creating drier conditions in your home.</p><p>"Meanwhile, the electronic type is a lot more energy consuming, but it tends to be extremely effective in removing the moisture from the air."</p><h2>INDOOR PLANTS</h2><p>Simon points out that the most practical and natural way to keep mould at bay is by using indoor plants as natural dehumidifiers.</p><p>"Certain ones are highly recommended for controlling the humidity in your house which is causing the mould," he explains.</p><p>"How useful a plant is in fighting damp and mould is to do with how much fog, dew, and moisture it tends to absorb."</p><p><strong>English Ivy</strong></p><p>The home expert notes that amongst the most common plant used for preventing damp and mould is the English Ivy.</p><p>"The climbing vine can significantly decrease the amount of mould already in the air," Simon explains.</p><p>"It’s known to filter around 78% of airborne mould in 12 hours, making it the best choice for anyone fighting with it."</p><p><strong>Palms</strong></p><p>The property whizz says that another great choice to control the moisture levels in your home and keep mould at bay are palms.</p><p>"More specifically, the bamboo, areca and lady palms are those types which have the ability to absorb the most moisture through their leaves, leaving your home free of pollutants" he explains.</p><p><strong>Peace Lily</strong></p><p>And let's not forget peace lilies, which Simon points out will thrive in dark and humid environments.</p><p>"This makes them the ideal plant for keeping mould and damp away from your home," Simon explains.</p><p>"Because it doesn’t require direct sunlight to absorb moisture through its leaves, it can be used in rooms such as the bathroom or any other humid place which doesn’t get much natural light in."</p><h2>CHARCOAL BAGS</h2><p>Simon also advises purchasing bags of activated charcoal to help you in preventing the occurrence of damp and mould in your house.</p><p>"It's nature’s best and most powerful odour absorber and is an ideal element in your fight against mould and dampness," he says.</p><p>"A single piece of charcoal can absorb moisture and odours for up to 2-3 months and many people use it as a ‘filter’ for the air in their house.</p><p>"Activated charcoal can help with controlling the humidity by removing the excess moisture in the air.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"For the convenience of household use, charcoal bags have been created."</p><p>Simon goes on to highlight that the bamboo charcoal air purifying bag is considered the most effective as well as natural way to absorb odours and moisture from the air - adding that without moisture mould cannot grow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/i-m-home-expert-three-789162384-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FqZ29vY2yAcLTOppxmnailsrPAjK2fq52VYq%2B2xdJmop6doGK6sMHLnWSdmZ2leqLAjJuYsmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-kate-quigley-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kate Quigley Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gabrielle-echols.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gabrielle Echols Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Wiki, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
