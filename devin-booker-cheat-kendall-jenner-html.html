Although the user did not reveal who Booker was with, the post’s title was “Dev Hooker,” followed by the question, “Devin having fun?” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later, the tea page followed up with another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blind item</a> that did not mention Booker explicitly, but fans were convinced that it was about him.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>The tipper mentioned that “a certain A list celebrity was spotted with someone other than his very famous reality star girlfriend.” They also noted that the celebrity always hosted pool parties that resembled more of a brothel.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>And the worst part of this situation was that the “celebrity” gave out his girlfriend’s brand of drink as party favors. It is worth noting that Jenner has her own tequila brand called 818.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Redditors Break Down the Cheating Allegations</h2><p>This blind item made its way to Reddit, where Redditors discussed if Booker really cheated on his girlfriend and the nature of the couple’s relationship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Many seemed to opine that the duo was probably in a fake PR relationship and that they met up once a week for the paparazzi, and the rest of the time, they did whatever they wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>One user reasoned that Jenner would benefit from the publicity even if the relationship involved cheating or was messy because, according to them, as a top model, it was better for her to be seen as promiscuous rather than sexually undesirable. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Another user agreed it was beneficial for Jenner but gave a different reason. They noted that her relationships would at least stop people from harping on her to get married and have babies because a relationship could mean a marriage would follow soon enough.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A third user noted that all the Kardashian/Jenner sisters collectively concluded that all the men they dated or married would cheat on them. Therefore, they did not consider cheating a deal breaker but a part of being in a relationship.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker's Reconcilation</h2><p>So far, neither Booker nor Jenner have spoken about their relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>On June 22, 2022, <a href=# rel="follow noopener">E!
