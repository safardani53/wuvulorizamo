The show quickly became a massive hit, earning a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Saturday Night Live spoof</a> and praise from celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Chrissy Teigen</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Reese Witherspoon</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Season 1 followed the elite cheerleading team at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Navarro College</a> as they rigorously trained for the 2019 national championships in Daytona, Florida — and a ton of drama ensued along the way. The equally exciting second season documented Navarro and their rivals down the road, Trinity Valley Community College, training for the 2020 and 2021 Daytona competitions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2022, several Cheer stars announced they were taking their stunts on the road for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>CHEER LIVE</a>. The tour saw Navarro alums like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Gabi Butler</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Morgan Simianer</a> reunite on the mat for the first time in two years, led by their head coach <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Monica Aldama</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Netflix</a> has yet to confirm if the series is returning for season 3 yet, but given that season 2 was a surprise, another run is not out of the question. Thanks to social media, fans already know how a potential third season would end — with a win at Daytona. Navarro reclaimed their national champion title at the 2022 cheer competition after a devastating loss to Trinity Valley the year prior.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following season, Butler joined the coaching staff, and she and Aldama led the team to yet <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>another Daytona win in April 2023</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that same month, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Navarro cheerleader filed a lawsuit against Aldama</a> for allegedly covering up a sexual assault incident. The head coach called the accusations "wildly inaccurate" in a statement obtained by PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the show's runaway success, its cast members' newfound fame and continued dedication to the sport offered them various opportunities.

Simianer created a line of '90s-esque <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>hair products with Conair and Scünci</a>, and curated exclusive items like "werk it" and "yas queen" lashes for her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Morgan Simianer x LashyBox</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she retired from her sport, Simianer told PEOPLE in January 2022 that she hopes to remain close to the cheerleading world. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I've been doing a lot of amazing opportunities</a>.

The couple started dating in early 2021, and Burleson proposed to Simianer with a Kay Jewelers custom Neil Lane diamond ring. "I'm so excited I get to marry my best friend," Simianer told PEOPLE in March 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simianer celebrated her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"Bach and Boujee" bachelorette</a> party in January 2023 with fellow Navarro alums, Austin Bayles and Justin Hinsley.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@micahcookphotos</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On May 28, 2023, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the former cheerleader tied the knot</a> in front of 275 guests&nbsp;in Hickory Creek, Texas.

Though the 25-year-old had two years left of eligibility for college athletics as of November 2022, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE that her time at Navarro is "done."</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Butler is currently still cheering with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Empire Athletics</a>, but she's excited about a new sport: wrestling. The Navarro alum signed a contract with WWE in November 2022. "It's very related to cheerleading because … we like to put on a show and we also have to be athletic," she explained to PEOPLE. The Cheer star won't be in the ring yet, but she's looking forward to it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for her personal life, Butler is currently dating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ricky Nunn</a>, a fellow cheerleader. He called her an "amazing soul and a blessing to my life" in a Jan. 17 Instagram post for her birthday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December 2022, Butler was accused of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wearing blackface</a> after a Twitter account, CHEER Confessions Inc., posted an incriminating old photo of her. Butler responded with a since-deleted Twitter statement, saying that veteran teammates had encouraged everyone to paint their faces. She also claimed not to know what blackface was at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her former teammate, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>La'Darius Marshall</a>, responded on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Twitter</a>, claiming that he had "personally talked" to Gabi and "said that it was not a good idea" when members of the team wanted to paint their faces. "So no we didn't all feel the same, I forgave you for it but don't sit on here and LIE," he wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marshall spoke on the situation again in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TikTok</a> in February 2023, claiming that he previously defended Butler because they were in a romantic relationship while at Navarro. "I'm tired. I'm no longer backing her. The only reason I was backing her is because we were sleeping together," he said. Butler has yet to respond to Marshall's claims.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2023, Butler announced that she'd joined the coaching staff at Navarro.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Taking on daytona with a slightly different role this time," she captioned a photo of her and Aldama in identical outfits on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few weeks later, the dynamic coaching duo led their cheer team to yet another Daytona victory.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"TAKE ME TO THE WATER 😍😭🥹 I AM SO BEYOND PROUD OF ALL OF YOU!!!!!!! the routine you guys put out was hands down one of the most beautiful routines i've ever seen….

After season 1 aired, however, he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cut</a> he was in a "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dark place</a>" after filming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I never wanted to be perceived as a victim," Marshall, who opened up about his experience as a survivor of sexual abuse on the show, explained. "I don't like the word … I know what I've been through, but look how far I made it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the athlete was thankful that Cheer gave him a platform to tell his story, and explained that the series taught him to lower his "shields."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marshall returned to Navarro for season 2 of cheer, though his relationship with head coach Monica Aldama quickly deteriorated after Aldama temporarily left the college to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>compete on Dancing with the Stars</a>. Their falling out surprised both viewers and Marshall's fellow teammates, as he and Aldama had always been especially close. Marshall ended up leaving Navarro and called out Aldama's actions during a social media rant, though the two later reconciled at the end of season 2.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Currently, the now-24-year-old is still involved with cheerleading, but as a coach for Idaho All-Star Cheer. He reflected on his journey from athlete to coach in a January 2023 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram post</a>, writing that his experience moving to Idaho has been "life altering."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Meeting the kids for the first time and telling them they would some day be champions and having them look at me as if I was a Lunatic for believing in them that much gave me the giggles," he wrote, adding that as a coach of young athletes, he's prioritized "free range communication" with his kids above all else.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, Marshall made headlines after calling out his former teammate Butler for her past actions. In a series of several TikToks, he also claimed that the pair were romantic as teammates. "That's the only reason we dealt with each other, is because we were with each other. This girl literally slept in my dorm every single day when we were at Navarro," he wrote in one video.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lexi-brumback></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Lexi Brumback</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lexi Brumback Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Star tumbler <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lexi Brumback</a> became a fan-favorite during season 1 of Cheer thanks to her gymnastic skills and her carefree approach to the intense sport. However, fans were disappointed when Brumback was kicked off the team at the end of the season after illegal substances were found in her car.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brumback later received a second chance from head coach Monica Aldama and returned to the squad for season 2.

"I'm what I make of them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brumback began preparing for the 2020 National Championship along with her teammates before the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>competition was canceled</a> due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The cheerleader ended up leaving Navarro mid-way through season 2, later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>telling Popsugar</a> that her departure was due to academics. And though she was sad to leave her teammates, Brumback was focused on the future.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love cheer, it was a huge part of my life, but that's not the career path that I want to take," she told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After gaining over 750,000 followers on Instagram thanks to her Cheer fame, Brumback became an influencer and regularly shares updates from her travels with fans.

She continued to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>coach her Navarro squad from afar</a> while filming the series in Los Angeles, telling PEOPLE, "We've done some Zooms, and I get videos every single day of practice, check-ins and stuff."
