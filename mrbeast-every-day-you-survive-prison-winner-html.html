Several people made allegations that his video was “promoting solitary confinement.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They also added that solitary confinement resulted in various mental problems for prisoners, including psychosis, memory loss, and suicidal thoughts.</p><h2>MrBeast Challenge Winner Speaks Against Allegations</h2><p>The accusations gained much attention, and several internet personalities discussed the topic. Charles Peralo, a popular TikTok personality, also covered it.</p><p>In a short <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TikTok video</a>, Peralo outlined the accusations and noted they were misguided. Especially because the participant, named Josh, could physically interact with people and talk to MrBeast and his team whenever he wanted. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Peralo further added that it wasn’t the first time MrBeast had come <a href=# rel=follow>under fire</a> for his video, as he had previously landed in hot water for his “$456,000 Squid Game In Real Life” video.</p><p>Peralo ended his TikTok video by saying, “people just need to learn to relax,” explaining&nbsp;how the previous act of comparing MrBeast to the elite from Squid Game was ridiculous.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Josh shared Peralo’s video and shut down the allegations of MrBeast endangering his mental health personally. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“I can assure you that they had people watching over me 24/7,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he said</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“They made sure I wasn’t in any danger, physically or mentally, they had everything taken care of. It was a great opportunity for me to relax a little bit.”</p><h2>Josh Proposed after the Challenge</h2><p>After taking on the challenge, Josh managed to stick it out for over three weeks. Most of the things present in the challenge room were taken away and the only things left were the bed and a guitar.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And on day 22, Josh smashed his guitar as he had nothing else to do and received a big surprise. A $100,000 cheque was hidden inside the musical instrument.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Combining his daily reward of $10,000, the $100,000 cheque, as well as other awards he had won, Josh earned $340,000 by the end of the video.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>MrBeast challenge winner Josh proposed to his girlfriend at the end of the video.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the video didn’t end there. It also documented Josh proposing to his girlfriend with a $20,000 ring, which he had sent Chris and Chandler to get while he was in isolation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“On a real note, though, I have been wanting to propose to Kenna for years now,” he said. “Being trapped in here made me realize how valuable time is, and I’m just done waiting.”</p><p>Josh and his girlfriend were then joined by their family to celebrate the occasion.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWil7Kiv9NmnK%2Bdoq56pa3YZrCorV2owrPCyK%2BcZqiinsCwuoywoKemlad7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./holly-willoughby-bidding-war-major-career-move.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Holly Willoughby at centre of bidding war as she eyes up major career move after 'kidnap' plot</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kanye-west-wears-wedding-ring-amid-kim-kardashian-split-rumors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kanye West Wears Wedding Ring Amid Kim Kardashian Split Rumors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
