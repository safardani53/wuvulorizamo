While Spears was seeing the photographer, she was in the midst of her divorce from <a href=#><strong>Kevin Federline</strong></a>.

But not just a robot — a sort of child-robot. I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself,” Britney <a href=#>writes of the conservatorship</a> in a passage published by People. “The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child. I became more of an entity than a person onstage. I had always felt music in my bones and my blood; they stole that from me.”</p><p>In 2009, Jamie filed for a restraining order against Ghalib, Britney’s former associate <strong>Sam Lufti</strong> and lawyer<strong> Jon Eardley</strong> and accused the trio of trying to meddle with the conservatorship. The restraining order was granted for three years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following her romance with Ghalib, Britney moved on with former manager <a href=#><strong>Jason Trawick</strong></a>. The twosome got engaged in 2011 but called off their nuptials two years later. Britney wouldn’t walk down the aisle until 2022 when she and <a href=#><strong>Sam Ashgari</strong></a> wed after dating for nearly 6 years. However, Ashgari, 28, <a href=#>filed for divorce </a>from Britney, citing irreconcilable differences in August after one year of marriage.</p><p>The Woman in Me hits shelves on Tuesday, October 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpu6bFjKynnpmiqHqltcOnq2ajnqTEbr%2FHnmSwmaNivam706ieq5mgnbKzecCdpZqmo2K6qr%2FTq5ysq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./medcity-moves.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | MedCity Moves podcast episodes download Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sheryl-bradys-boyfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Sheryl Brady Dating Sheryl Brady's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
