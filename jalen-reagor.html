He used to get up early and workout, and was even concerned about the diet from such an early age.</span></p><p><span>With age, his strength and speed increased, making it clear that he would be an athlete, and it would not matter if he chooses not to follow his father’s footsteps.</span></p><h2><span id=College_career class=mw-headline>Jalen Reagor | College career</span></h2><p>Reagor went to Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, in the summer of 2017 and made his debut from college in the Horned Frogs’ season inauguration against Jackson State with two meetings in TCU’s 63–0 victory.&nbsp;</p><p>He made his first touchdown in his college career within two weeks later when he caught a Hail Mary pass from quarterback Kenny Hill on the last play of the first-half triumph over SMU.</p><p>He made touchdowns in each of the last four games of the session, consisting of TCU’s first-ever appearance in the Big 12 Championship Game-winning win in the 2017 Alamo Bowl over Stanford.&nbsp;</p><p>For his time and effort, he was named Co-Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year.</p><p>Ere his student season, Reagor turned to jersey number 1 from the 18 he’d worn in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>That fall, he became the Frogs’ go-to receiver in a season where they used three distinctive starting quarterbacks, becoming the first TCU receiver to top 1,000 yards since Josh Doctson.</p><p>He had a streak of 7 straight games with a receiving touchdown, which included a win against&nbsp;Oklahoma State&nbsp;in which he also recorded his first career 100-yard rushing game.&nbsp;</p><p>After the season, he was named 2nd-team All-Big 12.</p><p>&nbsp;In his 2019 season, he had 43 catches for 611 yards. Reagor declared for the&nbsp;2020 NFL Draft&nbsp;after this season, forgoing his final year of eligibility.</p><h3>Furthermore</h3><p>Reagor was chosen by the Philadelphia Eagles in the initial step with the 21st overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, becoming the highest-drafted wide receiver to come from TCU since previous All-American Josh Doctson in 2016.</p><p>Reagor signed a 4-year $13.3 million contract with the team, with a fifth-year team option on July 20, 2020.</p><p>He packed a shoulder injury in training camp but healed enough to play in Week 1.</p><p>Later, he made his NFL debut next to the Washington Football Team, ending with one opening for 55 yards in the 17–27 loss on September 13, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>He was placed on a wounded sanctuary on September 30, 2020, after sustaining a ligament tear in his thumb.&nbsp;</p><p>On October 31, 2020, he was initiated.&nbsp;In Week 8 against the&nbsp;Dallas Cowboys&nbsp;on&nbsp;<i>Sunday Night Football</i>, Reagor recorded his initial career touchdown reception during the 23–9 win.</p><p>In Week 13 against the Green Bay Packers, Reagor turned a punt for a 73-yard touchdown during the 30–16 loss.</p><p>This was Reagor’s leading career punt returned for a touchdown.</p><h2>Jalen Reagor | Injuries and rising up</h2><p>Step by step, game by game, a visible difference had initiated to be seen in Eagles wide receiver Jalen Reagor.</p><p>He gradually started growing more confident in the offense and the punt return game, and in 2020 in Green Bay, it all came collectively.</p><p>All the things the Eagles adored about Reagor in the 2020 NFL Draft were on show in a measure of just one quarter.</p><p>Initially, he ran off from the defense to catch a precise Jalen Hurts pass that gained 34 yards.</p><p>Then he nursed the team gets to within one score of Green Bay with an explosive 73-yard punt return for a touchdown down the sidelines, conferring vigor and the burst that variations-makers have.</p><p>Action by action. Match by match.</p><p>Reagor initiated his upliftment.</p><p>“Honing in on my procedure that I pulled on all week in training and then carrying it into the game and using it and, as you guys (reporters) say, getting division,” Reagor said.</p><h3>Further</h3><p>“That’s rather much what I did – going over things in practice and running with Coach (Aaron) Moorehead, just concerning those things to the sport.”</p><p>He came to battled some injuries in the 2020 season – a shoulder sprain in Training Camp and a thumb pain early in the regular season – that has stunted his maturity.</p><p>But Reagor has also caught 20 passes for 256 yards and a touchdown in seven games. The touchdown return was only the third punt return of his NFL career.</p><p>When it’s all broken down, and with four games still to play in 2020’s regular season, Reagor has made strides noticeable to all.</p><p>He has missed reps because of the injuries, and, obviously, he has missed game action and the chance to work his way more deeply into the offense.</p><p>Having this bizarro-world rookie season with no Organized Team Activities and no real social bonding with his teammates has been another wrench in his best-laid plans.</p><p>Still, the relentlessly optimistic Reagor is moving on with confidence.</p><p>“It is a hindrance because it’s also repping that you lose. I dropped five games, and that’s a lot of reps pending how much I play now,” he said.</p><p>“Wondering if I went to those five games – all those reps, all those live reps and looks … It does set you back, but I can’t make apologies. I have to pick up where I left off.”</p><h3>Upliftment</h3><p>Reagor’s locus is “on what I’m here to do.”</p><p>I’m just here in all my strength to make the quarterback right,” as he responded to question after question about his prospect of the quarterback change from <a href=# rel=noopener>Carson Wentz</a> to Hurts.</p><p>As the Eagles extend the workload of their 2020 Rookie Class.</p><p>Hurts is rising, Reagor is inciting, and fourth-round draft pick Jack Driscoll is set for his third start at right gear.</p><p>The first pick, Reagor, is just now shedding the shackles of his injury setbacks to show what he can really do.</p><h3>Has Jalen recovered from injury?</h3><p>Yes, he has successfully recovered from his injury and hence has signed three contracts till 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC2wKWcp2Wimq6ou9Fo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jasmine-keiko-payne-iv9s-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jasmine Keiko Payne (TikTok Star) -</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-sebastian-moy-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Sebastian Moy Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
