The new mom says she knew the thump was the sound of Colton hitting the floor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He started to cry immediately. I've never seen his dad move that fast ever. Blake dropped everything and ran into the room to get him," Ferguson recalls. "On the side of his head there was a bump… Colton is my first baby, so I'm a paranoid first-time mom and I wanted to get him checked out just to be sure."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Paige Ferguson</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The concerned parents rushed Colton to the hospital, and Ferguson says the little boy smiled and cooed the entire ride. So, Ferguson and Clinton were surprised when a CT scan showed that the baby had a fractured skull.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I remember putting my head down on the bed and I was just crying and crying. I couldn't fathom the idea of something seemingly so minor causing such damage," she tells PEOPLE. "I couldn't hold it together. I will never lie and say that I was strong in that moment. I really wasn't. I kept hugging Blake and saying, 'I'm sorry.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Colton was taken by helicopter to Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. There he underwent emergency brain surgery and went into cardiac arrest for nearly 10 minutes, Ferguson tells PEOPLE.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Paige Ferguson</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They didn't think he would live at all. I walked into the ICU after his surgery and the doctor came up to me. Her exact words were, 'Ma'am, I need you to understand that most likely your son is going to die from this,' " she recalls through tears.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Paige Ferguson</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adds Ferguson, "I was in disbelief. I still am. I just kept praying, and praying. I couldn't wrap my head around it. It felt like I was in a horrible dream. Like, this can't be real."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Colton remained in the hospital for a month, where he underwent another brain surgery and more than a dozen blood transfusions. Then, much to the surprise of the medical staff, Colton was well enough to return home.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Paige Ferguson</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was amazing. Colton was a miracle. At all of our follow-up appointments, the doctors have said, 'I'm not trying to be mean, but your child should be dead. People do not live through the injury he had. He is absolutely a miracle,' " Ferguson recalls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I really give all the glory to God for everything that Colton does now and will continue to do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Colton survived the injury, Ferguson says the little boy suffered severe damage to his brain, and hasn't been the same since.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Paige Ferguson</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's very different. He's not the same Colton that he was before. Even right before his accident he was constantly babbling at us, now he doesn't talk," she tells PEOPLE. "He doesn't babble anymore. He's irritable all the time. He's very stiff. I could be holding him, and I miss him so much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a result of the incident, Colton developed severe epilepsy and takes seizure medications, Ferguson says, adding that the baby also uses a feeding tube. She says doctors expect Colton to have cerebral palsy when he is older and he'll have trouble walking and talking.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Paige Ferguson</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's the strongest child I've ever seen in my entire life. Because of the cardiac arrest, Colton's entire brain was affected," Ferguson says. "I will do everything in my power to ensure he has a happy life. I really think he's going to do more than what [the doctors] think he will. But I'm also very fearful for his future."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family has set up a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>GoFundMe</a> page to cover Colton's medical expenses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e8Koo62nnmK9orXGnmSfnaKcwrS7zWaZmpqpYq%2BmsIyfmKWkXZe%2ForXNaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-tried-kendall-jenners-contour-ice-cube.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I tried Kendall Jenner's 'contour ice cube' &amp;amp; saw results within a week - it wiped years off</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-rebecca-miller-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Rebecca Miller Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
