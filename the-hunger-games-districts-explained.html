Like how <a href=#>Panem</a> came to be, why the games actually started, and how the <a href=#>districts in The Hunger Games</a> actually work. Some fans are still a little unclear about the geography of it all, especially since some have taken to TikTok to joke that the bullet train in the movies makes it seem like the districts are all in a straight line in the country.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Spoiler alert: thatâ€™s not the case at all. So if you need a refresher course in what these districts each contribute, how wealthy or destitute they are, and where they actually are on a map of Panem / the United States, we have you covered. Just donâ€™t expect us to pick a side between Peeta and Gale, OK?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">â€˜The Hunger Gamesâ€™ districts, explained.</h2><p>Although The Hunger Games first presents Panem as being made up of 12 districts, we learn that there is a 13th that was thought to be obliterated by The Capitol. The remaining residents moved underground, where they lived for quite some time, despite the rest of Panem believing they were all dead. District 13 is located in the northeast region of the U.S., near what we know as Maine, and comprised of other small states in the area. But let's get into the others.</p><p><strong>District 12:</strong> This district is located in the Appalachia area where West Virginia and surrounding states are in the U.S. The primary source of work here is coal mining, which was Katnissâ€™s fatherâ€™s job before his death. The district eventually goes on to make medicines and the mines were closed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Okay, but how big are the districts in The Hunger Games books? I could never figure it out because the maps make them look like the size of states but from the description of like, District 12 it just sounds like a somewhat large town. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/r3SPTSaRSb</a></p>â€” kayley ðŸ¦‹ (@simplyxkayley) <a href=#>October 20, 2020</a></figure><p><strong>District 11:</strong> This is another poor district in Panem, though it yields plenty of things the country needs. Because of its location in the south, comprised of states like Georgia and Alabama, District 11 is known for crops, orchards, and livestock farms.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><strong>District 10:</strong> In terms of what we know as the U.S., District 10 is located primarily in Texas. While we donâ€™t hear much about this district in the books or the movies, itâ€™s known for its livestock, which makes sense since there are plenty of farms in the Texas region in real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><strong>District 9:</strong> Some of the District 9 states include Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska, which tells you just how large this district is. Its primary export for Panem is grain. Though other than that, not much else is known about this district, which has unnamed former victors.</p><p><strong>District 8:</strong> Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and part of Illinois makes up District 8 in The Hunger Games. Itâ€™s a region dedicated to textiles and may even be to thank for all of Effie Trinketâ€™s iconic outfits? But the most important thing about this district is that it does join the rebels when Panem is overthrown.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>District 7:</strong> Fans likely remember Johanna as a former victor from District 7, who is brought back for the Quarter Quell. The district is made up of Washington state and even part of Canada and, as to be expected, its main benefit for the country is lumber.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><strong>District 6:</strong> While we see the train in The Hunger Games movies pass through all of the districts on the way to The Capitol, District 6 is the main transportation district of the country. Itâ€™s made up of Michigan, Wisconsin, and part of Canada.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><strong>District 5:</strong> In Panem, no district can survive without the others. And District 5, which controls the electricity and power for the entire country, proves that. Itâ€™s even the target in Mockingjay when rebels want to shut down power to the Capitol. Southern Utah and Arizona make up District 5.</p><p><strong>District 4: </strong>The top four districts are full of Panem citizens that are fed well and look increasingly glamorous. District 4, which is located in California, parts of Texas, and even parts of Mexico, is responsible for fishing. Readers and viewers may remember Finnick and Mags as part of District 4.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Annie's last name, Cresta, derives from "crest," which is the top (amplitude) of a wave.

It includes parts of multiple states, including Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><strong>District 2:</strong> This is where the Peacekeepers, or soldiers, train, and the rest of the residents are typically wealthy. New Mexico and Colorado make up the large district, and itâ€™s almost as influential and important as District 1.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><strong>District 1:</strong> This district trains its residents to be ready to win the games for their entire lives. The people in District 1 are wealthy and known for designing and building things that are used in The Capitol. Itâ€™s located throughout what we know as Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana.</p><p><strong>The Capitol:</strong> In the books, The Capitol is said to be located in Salt Lake City, which makes sense, given its proximity to the Rocky Mountains, where Peacekeepers are trained, and its nearly central location to other high-ranking districts.</p><p>Itâ€™s still unclear what the districts will look like in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, but weâ€™d be willing to bet The Hunger Games prequel is not without its own rebels under the surface.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmeceupaCdomK0ornErGSdoaOpv6qv06xknrCgoa6qusSd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ben-zobrist-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ben Zobrist Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sophie-turner-kisses-costar-on-set-while-filming-amid-joe-jonas-divorce-7970416.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Sophie Turner Kisses Costar on Set While Filming amid Joe Jonas Divorce</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
