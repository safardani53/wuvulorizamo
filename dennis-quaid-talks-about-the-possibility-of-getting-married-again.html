He credits his now-26-year-old son, actor&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Jack Quaid</strong></a>, for coming up with the band’s name when he was only 9 years old.</p><p>“We were wondering what to call ourselves and we couldn’t come up with it and he said, ‘Oh, The Sharks!'” he recalled. “He was at a rehearsal we were doing in the living room and it was Shark Week. I always say, ‘Thank God it wasn’t Dinosaur Week!'”</p><p>As for his relationship with Auzina, the Day After Tomorrow star says it’s pretty normal, despite their celebrity status.</p><p><span class="x_contextualExtensionHighlight x_ms-font-color-themePrimary x_ms-border-color-themePrimary x_ident_961_986" tabindex=0 role=button>“We love to go to dinner.</span>&nbsp;I love to go to dinner at Catch, that’s our favorite restaurant. Love that place,” he said of typical date nights with his 32-year-old girlfriend. “Or just make a special night where we’re on the road. Go someplace and have her find a great restaurant that she really wants to go to. Or something like going to The Nutcracker with the kids. Whatever it is to get out.”</p><p>The A Dog’s Journey star <a href=#>began dating the French-Canadian model</a> in August 2016, just two months after he <a href=#>split from his wife</a> of 12 years, <strong>Kimberly Quaid</strong>, with whom he shares 11-year-old twins Zoe and Thomas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Dennis-Quaid-Talks-Possibility-of-Getting-Married-Again-in-the-Future-embed.jpg><p>“After careful consideration, we have decided to end our 12-year marriage,” the exes said in a statement in June 2016. “The decision was made amicably and with mutual respect toward one another. We will always remain great friends and devoted partners in raising our children.”</p><p>Quaid explained he was planning on staying single following the divorce, but then he met his current girlfriend and the rest is history.</p><p>“I met [Santa] very close after my ex and I were separated. I was just going to be single and that was just going to be it when it came to love — and then Santa came along,”&nbsp;the Fortitude actor told <a href=#>The Sunday Times</a> on Sunday,&nbsp;December 2.</p><p>Dennis was also previously married to actress <strong>P. J. Soles</strong> from 1978 to 1983 and <a href=#><strong>Meg Ryan</strong></a> — who is the mother to Jack&nbsp;— from 1991 to 2001.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[It was] my <a href=#>most successful relationship</a>,” the Reagan star said of his marriage to the You’ve Got Mail actress, 57, on Megyn Kelly Today in July. “When we met, you know, I was the big deal. And then my career [came to a halt]. … We’d go out on the streets of New York and it would be like, ‘Meg! Meg!’ And I have to admit it, I actually did feel like I disappeared. I didn’t think I was that small, but I was. It was a growth opportunity. I learned from that.”</p><p>Ryan, meanwhile,&nbsp;has since moved on and announced her <a href=#>engagement to <strong>John Mellencamp</strong></a> last month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZ6jtrR50K6Yopxdqa6tt9JmmJunpal6tbTEZqeoq6Oer6q4yK2wZqeWYrSmwNOipaBlnZa%2Fs7XEnWSan5Geu3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./abraham-nova.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Abraham Nova net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bray-wyatt-wwe-superstar-dead-at-36.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bray Wyatt, WWE Superstar, Dead at 36</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
