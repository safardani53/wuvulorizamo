In January 2021, they attended a friend’s wedding as a couple and <a href=#>seemingly confirmed they were an item</a>.</p><p>The romance came just months after the TRON: Legacy actress announced in November 2020 that she and Sudeikis, 46, <a href=#>had called it quits after nearly a decade together</a>. The exes, <a href=#>who got engaged in 2013</a>, share two children:<a href=#> son Otis, 8, and daughter Daisy, 5</a>.</p><p>Wilde’s post-split relationship with the Ted Lasso star started out amicable, however, <a href=#>their custody battle took a turn in April</a> when Sudeikis publicly served Wilde with legal documents during CinemaCon as she was presenting her film.</p><p>“It was my workplace,” the House alum <a href=#>told Variety earlier this month</a> of the debacle. “In any other workplace, it would be seen as an attack. It was really upsetting. It shouldn’t have been able to happen.”</p><p>Wilde insisted “there was a huge breach in security, which is really scary” for the papers to get to her on stage. “The hurdles that you had to jump through to get into that room with several badges, plus special COVID tests that had to be taken days in advance, which gave you wristbands that were necessary to gain access to the event — this was something that required forethought,” she explained.</p><p>The <a href=#>Lazarus Effect actress</a> claimed that Sudeikis tried to “sabotage” her presentation by serving her with the documents in that manner. “Sadly, it was not something that was entirely surprising to me. I mean, there’s a reason I left that relationship,” she confessed.</p><p>In August court documents obtained by the Daily Mail, the Virginia native admitted that <a href=#>he wasn’t pleased with how and when Wilde received the papers</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I understand that the process server had only done her job; however, I deeply regret what happened,” Sudeikis explained. “Olivia’s talk was an important event for Olivia, both professionally and personally, and I am very, very sorry that the incident marred her special moment.”</p><p>Watch the video above for more on how Styles and Wilde are <a href=#>navigating the custody drama with Sudeikis</a> — and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoJWnsm60wKupsmWjqcatsdJmqq2ZnpnAbsPIrZ9mopGovK950q6bnqGbnsBurcyim2annJ7Dqq2MnamapZFk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-chandler-massey-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Chandler Massey Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sally-field-son-recalls-how-coming-out-inspired-brothers-and-sisters-storyline.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sally Field's Son on His Coming Out Inspiring Brothers &amp;amp; Sisters Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
