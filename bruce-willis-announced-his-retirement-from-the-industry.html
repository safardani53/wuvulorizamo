This fortune was amassed through his work as an actor, producer, and musician. The 67-year-old has been in the entertainment industry for six decades and is still one of the most famous and highest-paid actors of all time.</p><h2>Bruce Willis Career</h2><p>Bruce’s family moved to New Jersey in the late 1950s after he was born in Germany, and this is where his love of acting began.</p><p>After joining a high school drama club, he enrolled in Montclair State University’s Drama Program before moving to New York City to pursue a career in theater.</p><p>Throughout the 1970s, he appeared in a number of off-Broadway shows before moving to California in the 1980s, where he appeared in a number of TV shows, including No Exit and Miami Vice.</p><p>His first leading role was in the 1987 film Blind Date, but it was the 1988 film Die Hard that gave him his big break in Hollywood. Other notable film roles for the actor include Pulp Fiction (1994), Armageddon (1998), The Sixth Sense (1999), Oceans Twelve (2004), Apex (2021), and numerous others. He was also a moderately successful recording artist and producer in the 1980s.</p><h2>The Maximum Payout In Hollywood History</h2><p>The 67-year-earnings old’s from his role in the 1999 film The Sixth Sense is widely regarded as the highest in film history. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he earned a whopping $100 million in total, which included a $14 million upfront salary and a generous cut of the film’s gross.</p><p>Officially, that is the second-highest payment ever received by a single actor from a film, trailing only Keanu Reeves, who earned $156 million from The Matrix films.</p><p>However, Keanu earned this amount over the course of two films, whereas Bruce earned $100 million from just one. So, in our opinion, the Sixth Sense star takes the top spot.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZq62Tmnq4tculoKxlkaO7sMHNnJydZZiewG6%2BxK2gq52dmru1ecWrpqZlpJ2ybrXNnaysrKKufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chanel-jacket-dupe-hm-stunning-8k-cheaper.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I've found a Chanel jacket dupe from H&amp;amp;M - it's stunning and a whopping 8.5k cheaper than the posh</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-mcnulty-20020426-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anna McNulty (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
