Well, actually, the guy who played ‘Gary,’ <strong>Ross Hull</strong>, in the series was the only one from the pilot — he played ‘Frank’ in the pilot, the tough guy. But we recast everyone else,” co-creator <strong>D.J. MacHale</strong> told&nbsp;<a href=#>Complex</a>&nbsp;in October 2014. “When we got the series together, I wanted to cast Ryan in the Midnight Society because I knew the kid was really good, but then he got the gig with the&nbsp;<a href=#>Mickey Mouse Club</a>, with <a href=#><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a>. He went down to Florida to shoot that, and it ran for two years. When he came back to Canada, because he lived in Canada, I got him in an episode of our show.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ryan-Gosling-Are-You-Afraid-of-the-Dark.jpg><p><a href=#><strong>Jay Baruchel</strong></a> was another young actor who caught the 66-year-old author’s eye. “He’s probably been, kid wise, in more episodes than any other kid,” he recalled. “He was first in an episode called ‘The Dead Man’s Float,’ and we killed him in the first scene. [Laughs.] We drowned him in a pool. I thought, ‘Oh, my God — this is a kids’ show and we’re drowning this kid!’ I directed that episode, so I got in the pool with him, and we tied a filament to his ankle that ran down to a weight at the bottom of the pool and someone holding it at the bottom. I remember his mother was on the set and said to me, ‘I can’t believe you’re killing my kid!’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>MacHale added: “He was such a good kid and he lived in Montreal, so we ended up casting him in three or four more episodes. He was so good, easygoing and great with comedy, and he got the irony of the stuff. Jay and Ryan were two kids I knew would go on to do big, great things.”</p><p>Watch the video above to see more stars you forgot appeared on&nbsp;Are You Afraid of the Dark?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaGhqZaOprrO%2FjLKmrmWWpL%2Bou9Nmrp6qlWK8r3nAq5xmsZ%2BqeqKy0ZqgnWWfm3q1tMRmm5qqm2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-hall-bikini-kissing-joshua-hall-mexico-pda-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christina Hall Rocks Bikini While Kissing Joshua Hall In Mexico: Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-inspectah-deck-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Inspectah Deck Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
