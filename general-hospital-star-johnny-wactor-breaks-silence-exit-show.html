I knew that I would want to say something just because of my time there and my relationships with the people in the cast and crew. I was a little emotional," Johnny said, after wrapping his last scene.</p><p>The soaps actor did not expect to leave the show so soon after his character arrived, but assured the outlet there is no bad blood.</p><p>"I wish everyone at GH the best," he ended his statement.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Johnny is known for his career as an actor and has been seen in several productions over the years, including Siberia, Hollywood Girl,&nbsp;<a href=#>NCIS</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Criminal Minds</a>, and Barbee Rehab.</p><p>In 2022, he will also debut in the&nbsp;<a href=#>TV</a>&nbsp;movie Nightmare Diaries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/general-hospital-airs-monday-friday-762805315-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/general-hospital-star-johnny-wactor-763122768.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/johnny-wactor-attends-warner-bros-762805210.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYm59doKPaJ6eppWnrq15x6iqqaGklrluv9OaqWain527r8WMsJicrJ%2BneqO%2BxJqirGWjnrmmusKeZJ6wmal6tLTOsGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mae-questel-19080913-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mae Questel (Voice Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./donald-faison-shares-sweet-photo-with-kids-after-death-of-ex-wife-w471213.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Donald Faison Shares Sweet Photo With Kids After Death of Ex-Wife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
