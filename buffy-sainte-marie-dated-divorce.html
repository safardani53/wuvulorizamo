dated?</h2><p>The <a href=#>Oscar</a>-winning singer-songwriter has had a tumultuous dating life.</p><p>Though little is known about every partner linked to Sainte-Marie, the country folk musician was <a href=#>married</a> at least three times between her late 20s and late 40s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

married a <a href=#>Hawaiian</a> surfing teacher named Dewain Bugbee.</p><p>Their marriage was short-lived, with the couple calling it quits just a few years later.</p><h2

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/wife-american-singer-buffy-sainte-860069168.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Jack Nitzsche</h3><p>Sainte-Marie started dating Jack Nitzsche, an <a href=#>American</a> musician, composer, and arranger in the early 1980s.</p><p>Nitzsche was known primarily for working on <a href=#>film scores</a>, including <a href=#>The Exorcist</a>, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Blue Collar.</p><p>He also worked with the <a href=#>Rolling Stones</a>, <a href=#>Neil Young</a>, and served as the right-hand man of producer <a href=#>Phil Spector</a>.</p><p>The couple married on March 19, 1982.</p><p>In 1983, they won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for co-writing Up Where We Belong, a song written for the 1982 film An Officer and a Gentleman, starring <a href=#>Richard Gere</a>.</p><p>In a 2022 interview with <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>, Sainte-Marie says Nitzsche was "both brilliant [and] a nutcase."</p><p>She added that he was "horribly controlling" and constantly "demanding she put her career on hold for over a decade."</p><p>Sainte-Marie even claims "he skin-popped heroin into [me] when [I] was asleep."</p><p>By the early 1990s, their marriage was over, and the duo had gone their separate ways.</p><p>It is unclear whether the duo were ever officially <a href=#>divorced</a>.</p><p>Nitzsche suffered a stroke in 1998 which ultimately ended his career.</p><p>He passed away in August 2000 from a cardiac arrest.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Chuck Wilson</h3><p>Sainte-Marie entered a "committed relationship" with Hawaiian Chuck Wilson in 1993.</p><p>Little is known about Wilson, as he prefered to stay out of the spotlight, unlike his famous partner.</p><p>The couple lived in Kauai, an island in Kauai County, Hawaii.</p><p>It's unclear when the couple broke up, or whether they're still together.</p><p>In a 2009 article with the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honolulu Advertiser</a>, Sainte-Marie said: "I'm single and anonymous, it's a blessing in my life, having it both ways."</p><p>"Anonymity is a precious thing; I love being famous, but I love anonymity more."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Buffy Sainte-Marie?</h2><p>Sainte-Marie was born in Stoneham, <a href=#>Massachusetts</a>, in 1941 to parents Albert and Winifred Santamaria.</p><p>Her father changed the family's surname to Sainte-Marie due to anti-Italian sentiment following <a href=#>WWII</a>.</p><p>Sainte-Marie graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, earning degrees in Oriental philosophy and teaching.</p><p>In 1963, Sainte-Marie briefly became addicted to codeine after recovering from a throat infection.</p><p>Her song, Cod'ine, was later recorded by multiple artists, including <a href=#>Janis Joplin</a>, the Barracudas, and <a href=#>Courtney Love</a>.</p><p>The song criticized both <a href=#>opioids</a> and the medical community's role in promoting them, decades before the opioid crisis would take center stage in the US.</p><p>In 1964, during a powwow on the Piapot Cree reserve in <a href=#>Canada</a>, Sainte-Marie was welcomed and "adopted" by the youngest son of Chief Piapot, Emile Piapot, and his wife, Clara Starblanket Piapot.</p><p>This experience shaped her songwriting, which focused on issues facing Indigenous peoples of the US and Canada.</p><p>Many of her songs deal with issues like environmental exploitation, spirituality, decolonization, and activism.</p><p>In her early to late 20s, Sainte-Marie spent time in <a href=#>New York City's</a> Greenwich Village, alongside other emerging artists including <a href=#>Leonard Cohen</a>, Neil Young, and <a href=#>Joni Mitchell</a>.</p><p>In 1975, Sainte-Marie was hired by <a href=#>Sesame Street</a> to present Native American programming for children for the first time.</p><p>She regularly appeared on the show until 1981 and even breastfed her son in a 1977 episode, one of the first representations of breastfeeding ever aired on television.</p><p>In the early 1980s, Sainte-Marie became one of the first artists to use computer technology to record her music and accompanying visual art, using Apple II and <a href=#>Macintosh</a> computers.</p><p>On September 21, 2015, her album Power in the Blood was named the winner of the 2015 Polaris Music Prize, beating out artists like <a href=#>Drake</a>, Caribou, and the New Pornographers.</p><p>On October 26, 2023, a <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBC investigation</a> reported that Sainte-Marie had falsely claimed her native identity and fabricated her Indigenous roots.</p><p>CBC published Sainte-Marie's official birth certificate, which indicated that she had been born to white parents of <a href=#>Italian</a> and English descent.</p><p>The singer had previously claimed that she had been removed from her birth home in Saskatchewan as an infant and <a href=#>adopted</a> by an American family.</p><p>In an article for the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toronto Star</a>, Cree author Darrel J. McLeod argued that while Sainte-Marie "is an honorary member of the Piapot family," the singer should acknowledge that she "grew up with a white family and white privilege."</p><p>Cree descendants of Piapot and Starblanket also <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued a statement</a>, saying: "We claim her as a member of our family and all of our family members are from the Piapot First Nation."</p><p>"To us, that holds far more weight than any paper documentation or colonial record keeping ever could."</p><p>In a statement <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on X</a>, formerly Twitter, before the CBC investigation was published, Sainte-Marie called the allegations "deeply hurtful" and "beyond traumatic."</p><p>She added that she was "proud" of her "indigenous-American identity, and the deep ties" she has "to Canada" and her "Piapot family."</p><p>"My indigenous identity is rooted in a deep connection to a community which has had a profound role in shaping my life and my work."</p><p>The singer's closing statement read "I may not know where I was born, but I know who I am."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/buffy-sainte-marie-attends-tiff-860069173.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When did Buffy Sainte-Marie retire?</h2><p>Sainte-Marie announced her retirement on August 3, 2023.</p><p>Her <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> listed a number of factors that contributed to her decision, including "travel-induced health concerns" and "performance-inhibiting physical challenges."</p><p>Sainte-Marie's decision, however, does not necessarily mean she won't be releasing any music in the future.</p><p>Instead, the singer said she was retiring from live performance.</p><p>In a personal message on her website, the singer stated: “I have made the difficult decision to pull out of all scheduled performances in the foreseeable future."</p><p>Sainte-Marie added that recent health issues were making it impossible for her to perform her music the way she wanted.</p><p>"Arthritic hands and a recent shoulder injury have made it no longer possible to perform to my standards."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She also apologized to her fans and support network: "Sincere regrets to all my fans and family, my band, and the support teams that make it all possible.”</p><p>Time will tell if Sainte-Marie will write or record any songs in the future.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZml%2FdYSPaJmunpauerStyKernmWdlr%2BqsYydmK2dlGKxqsLOq5qeZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-mike-pearson-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Mike Pearson Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-mills-age-wedding-husband-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Mills Age 31 Married Fiance Brett Young, 37 | Wedding In California</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
