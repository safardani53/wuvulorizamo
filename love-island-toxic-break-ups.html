said rugby player Greg “put a smile back on her face”.</p><p>However, just five weeks after winning the coveted £50,000, Greg allegedly dumped her over text, blaming their hectic schedules and the distance, as Greg lives in Ireland.</p><p>Amber said on Loose Women: “There was a call a few days prior, just chatting, not specifically to do with that, but definitely on that day, it was like a text.”</p><p>Greg hit back, claiming: "She knows that's not the truth.”</p><h2><strong>Broke up on own reality TV show</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5c26e7ad-23de-49d5-8ebd-c883411e410b-2.jpg><p><a href=#>Olivia Atwood</a> and <a href=#>Chris Hughes</a> came third in the 2017 series of Love Island, after weeks of non-stop bickering.</p><p>They went on to bag their own reality TV series, Crackin’ On, which was meant to showcase their relationship - but ended up airing their furious break-up.</p><p>The couple had blazing rows on-screen, with Chris finally calling it quits with the cameras still rolling.</p><p>Olivia later said she was “unhappy” for such a “raw moment” to be shown on TV, and accused her ex of planning it with the production team.</p><h2>'<strong>Disloyal'</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000422271361.jpg><p><a href=#>Georgia Steel</a> and <a href=#>Sam Bird</a> voluntarily left the villa together in 2018 after a dilemma forced them to choose between staying or being a couple.</p><p>Their relationship didn't last very long though, as within months Sam accused Georgia of cheating with her ex-boyfriend.</p><p>He said he'd found a suspicious selfie of Georgia in bed with her ex as well as explicit texts.</p><p>Georgia denied the allegations, and said Sam made her feel “miserable” during the relationship.</p><p>The break-up was so toxic the pair couldn't help having an explosive argument during the Love Island Christmas special.</p><h2><strong>Social media spat</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/d7f6418e-171c-454c-a111-c0a34df127aa.jpg><p><a href=#>Megan Barton-Hanson</a> and <a href=#>Wes Nelson</a> were a polarising couple during their tumultuous time on Love Island 2018.</p><p>They finished in fourth place and continued dating outside the villa for about six months -
