On October 14, 2022, the Supreme Court’s third division affirmed the rapper’s one-year jail term.&nbsp;Jang Yong-jun, also known as NO:EL, is the son of politician Jang Je-won, a United Future Party Member of the National Assembly. He is a self-taught rapper who debuted in 2017. Music has always been a passion for the singer/rapper. However, his past of wrongdoing has tarnished him.</p><p></p><h2>A short history of NO:EL misbehavior-related</h2><p>The Korean rapper was discovered driving a Mercedes Benz in the Banpo of Seoul’s Seocho District on September 18, 2021, and was involved in an accident. When the cops arrived at the crime site, they attempted to check his alcohol levels and driver’s license. He, on the other hand, refused to comply and instead smacked them on the head.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NO-EL-1.jpg alt=NO:EL width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>NO:EL was condemned to one year in jail after the first two trials. However, he was acquitted of inflicting bodily harm to a police officer since the injuries were minor. NO:EL subsequently filed an appeal against the verdict, which was forwarded to the Supreme Court. He was sentenced to one year in jail after the appeals court upheld the initial judgment.&nbsp;In 2020, he was sentenced to one year and six months in jail, as well as two years of probation, for driving under the influence. He also attempted to swap drivers in order to conceal his error.</p><p>He then repeated the same offence and was arrested with an arrest warrant on October 12, 2021, within his probation term. NO:EL was detained while the trial was taking place. However, he was released at the end of the month when his detention was lifted. After being imprisoned for a year, he was freed on October 9, 2022.&nbsp;Furthermore, in 2019, he struck a motorcyclist while driving intoxicated and then worked as a social worker to atone for his error.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NOEL.jpg alt=NO:EL width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In the midst of the rapper’s misdeeds and judicial processes, K-netizens welcome the Supreme Court’s latest judgment.&nbsp;As a musician, the 22-year-old last released a studio album named 21’S/S in 2021. He has released three studio albums, two extended plays, and a handful of singles alongside other rappers including Justhis, Kid Milli, Young B, Giriboy, and Swings since his debut.</p><p>In other developments, VICTON’s Heo Chan was kicked out of the group after being caught driving under the influence of alcohol. IST Entertainment, the group’s agency, issued a formal statement to provide further information on the situation.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>NO:EL</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Rapper</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGilqJ2cYq5ut86rnJqmXaeusbzEq2ShmaNir6axzWaqnqakmrukscNmq6hln6OybsXEmqlmoZ5it6K1y2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./old-tanning-mom-photos-what-a-hottie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Old Tanning Mom Photos: What a HOTTIE!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sienna-mae-gomez-new-boyfriend-cole-hosman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Cole Hosman Sienna Mae Gomezs Secret New Boyfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
