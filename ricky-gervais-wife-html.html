But he claimed that the true loss he'll ever feel is the loss of Fallon, his soulmate.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In this regard, After Life depicts Tony, a devastated widower played by the comedian, suffering from his mental health following the death of his wife, who was diagnosed with cancer.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As a result of the show's depiction of a romance between the man and his wife, the show has gained a devoted following of viewers.</p><p>But, over anything, it's the nostalgic representation of the couple's happier times shown through home footage.</p><p>Through this expression of losing a fictional wife, Gervais conveys the need to be in the moment and not live in the shadow of death. He is an advocate of having a quality life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Life Now And Before 'After Life'</h2><p>To her credit, Fallon is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">best-selling novelist</a> whose books include Tell Me A Secret and My Sweet Revenge. She was also a successful television producer, whose credits include the hit BBC soap opera EastEnders. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She and Gervais have been together since 1982, meeting first at University College London. Throughout this time frame, they had no plans to be married.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, when Ellen DeGeneres asked him about having a baby, Gervais said he would be worried sick. He further elaborated that he doesn't have any kids because there are already too many of them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He also doesn't think that people are concerned about him not making any kids and doesn't see the point of always fretting for a 16-year stretch. Instead of kids, the couple is animal lovers and has had various pets.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>A cat named Ollie had been their constant companion. Sadly, he passed away in 2020.&nbsp;Gervais and Fallon's Twitter feeds were often updated with his antics and now stand as a tribute to the feline.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Fortunately for them, Pickle, another cat they were fostering but ultimately adopted, has become their new furry friend.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Ricky Gervais posing with his cat, Pickles.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The show also sees Tony adopting a dog to get over the loneliness. Gervais also intends to give his earnings to various animal non-profits upon his death.</p><p>That being said, he and Fallon haven't always been in a place to give charity. Their humble beginnings were very much that.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In another interview, Fallon <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;the couple had no money and lived above a brothel in Kings Cross, London, until their good fortunes arrived.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She also commented that she was the sole breadwinner, earning £40 a week working as a script editor at a theatrical agency.&nbsp;</p><p>They would freeze to death every winter because they couldn't afford the meagerly cost to keep the heating on.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Today, Gervais is worth approximately £100 million, and Fallon is projected to be worth roughly £3 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKqZmLi6ecaeqa%2BZmah6uLXFnmWhrJ2h</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tj-lavin-in-coma-after-horrific-bmx-accident.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>T.J.
