We're kind of the same person; we think the same way. That's always made it work — that's why it's lasted. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is, but it works and it's great," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Rupert Grint's partner, Georgia Groome.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-has-been-acting-since-she-was-a-kid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She has been acting since she was a kid</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David M.

She starred as 11-year-old runaway Joanne in the 2006 film London to Brighton when she was a young teen and went on to star in the film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging in 2008.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She has continued to have a few roles over the years and starred in the 2017 horror/comedy film Double Date.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-a-feminist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She's a feminist</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, the actress took her acting chops from the screen to the stage when she starred as Nicola, a young woman who's been blackmailed with revenge porn, in the Theatre503 production of Clickbait. While promoting the production, Groome was interviewed by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Red Carpet News TV</a> and had a few things to say about the topic of feminism.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think it's important for women to do whatever we think we need to do and I'm fully behind all of that," she said. "If we don't put the message out there, it's kind of ignored and those publications that continue to run like Page Three and stuff like that are going to continue. I think just in terms of women not being sexual objects is really important and it will stop a lot of bad things that happen to women from happening, if we take that stigma away."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-grint-have-been-dating-since-2011></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Grint have been dating since 2011</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Grint and Groome have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>largely kept their relationship</a> private, they've reportedly been dating since 2011.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple sparked marriage rumors in April 2019 when they were photographed wearing matching gold rings, however, a spokesman for the actor denied that the couple had married in a statement to The Sun.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-has-a-daughter-with-grint></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She has a daughter with Grint</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rupert Grint Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Grint and Groome became parents in May 2020 with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>birth of their daughter</a>, Wednesday G.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few months later, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Knock at the Cabin</a> star shared the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>first photo of their daughter</a> on Instagram, also marking his first-ever Instagram post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Hey Instagram....only 10 years late, but here I am," he wrote alongside a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo of himself and his baby girl</a>. "Grint on the Gram! Here to introduce you all to Wednesday G. Grint. Stay safe, Rupert."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2022, Grint appeared on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Tonight Show</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>chatted about his daughter's moniker</a> with host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jimmy Fallon</a>. "It's a good name isn't it? It's a strong name," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Fallon asked why Grint chose Wednesday, he explained, "Well I'm always hesitant to say it was The Addams Family but it was, yea, kind of The Addams Family. I just always loved the name, it's a good name – Wednesday G. Grint – it's kind of memorable." He went on to say that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Samuel L. Jackson</a> inspired him in giving her the middle initial G.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Grint also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>revealed Wednesday's first words</a>. "Mama, Dada, and the F-word came pretty quick," he joked. "She spends a lot of time outside my dressing room, when I'm doing my lines for this [Servant] and my character says the F-word a lot. And now she just says it whenever she's excited."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2022, Wednesday joined her dad on set as he filmed season 3 of Apple TV's Servant. Grint shared an adorable snap of the toddler sitting in a mini director's chair on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she's not helping her dad out on set, Wednesday enjoys trips to Target. During a January 2023 appearance on The Tonight Show, Grint discussed his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>daughter's obsession with the chain store</a>. "She is obsessed with Target," he explained. "She'd choose that over going to the park, or zoo. But she loves going to different Targets and seeing how the layout is kind of slightly different."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the U.K. doesn't have Target, the doting father built her a mini Target play set in his and Groome's home. "I think I've definitely captured the essence," he claimed. "It was one of the most difficult conversations, telling her she lives in a country that doesn't have Target."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-enjoys-horror-films></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She enjoys horror films</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the premiere of her 2017 film Double Date, Groome discussed her latest project and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>her love for the horror genre</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Well I think the nice thing about horror is that people still go to the cinema to watch it," she explained. "I never watch a horror film on my own, I like to have other people to bounce off ... it's a genre that kind of brings people together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also said she specifically liked the way Double Date subverted the common horror film tropes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Especially with horror as a genre, you're ready to see the girl covered in blood, going 'Ahhh,' and running for her life, and in this it's completely reversed which is just really fun to play with because it's funnier actually to see men running for their life and screaming and crying, so that was really nice and quite exciting," she shared.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-grint-are-very-private></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Grint are very private</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Grint joined Instagram in November 2020, Groome does not have any social media herself. She also rarely conducts public interviews, nor does she accompany her movie star boyfriend to premieres and red carpets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the occasional rare glimpse of his daughter, Grint mainly uses his social media to promote his work projects and he has never posted photos of Groome. He explained his reasoning for this during his appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Tonight Show</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ultimately, I think it just doesn't go with my personality," he told Fallon. "I'm quite a shy person and the thought of kind of sharing my life just didn't seem like it would really fit." He added that he's "terrible" at Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's really hard, I never know what to post ... It's mainly Servant trailers and the back of my daughter's head," he joked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0miuoaddnsBus8SoqaChkWK0s7vOppxmqqWlsrPAjKCpoqakZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harry-b-harris-jr.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Harry B.
