The ladies looked stunning in their ensembles, with each member exuding glitter. However, two months later, a few netizens noted that Jiwoo‚Äôs posture in the official photos seemed to be incorrect. They compared the photographs and videos from the press conference to the official ones issued by JYPE. Jiwoo‚Äôs legs had been altered to seem thinner, they discovered upon closer investigation.</p><p>On the controversial Pann Nate website, netizens chastised the corporation for modifying the NMIXX member‚Äôs physique. However, some trolls targeted the organization as well.</p><h2>Netizens bring to light NMIXX‚Äôs manipulated images</h2><p>On February 22 of this year, NMIXX made an explosive debut with the title single O.O from their first album Ad Mare. Since then, the group has been in the limelight for a variety of reasons, both good and bad.&nbsp;A South Korean netizen recently found that the group‚Äôs agency, JYP Entertainment, had manipulated images shot at a special occasion. Jiwoo, who was dressed in an enormous brown coat and a short black skirt, seemed different in the official photos. The 17-year-old singer has already been body-shamed. When netizens viewed the WOOYOUNGMI red carpet photographs shared by JYP Entertainment, many speculated that they were manipulated.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>[ notpannchoa ] JYP caught catfishing NMIXX‚Äôs proportions <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aMAE95x711</a></p><p>‚Äî notpannchoa/notpannkpop/notnetizenbuzz (@notpannchoa2) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2022</a></p><p>They discovered Jiwoo‚Äôs face and legs had been edited to make her seem slimmer after comparing films filmed on the same red carpet and press photographs to official photos.

In the case of the latter, the unrealistic aesthetic standards of the K-pop business became a prominent subject of discussion.
