Kylie, 31, and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, were the next pieces of the puzzle.</p><p>“Travis Kelce’s brother is Jason Kelce, who is married to Kylie Kelce,” the video continued. “Both Selena Gomez and Kylie Kelce follow me on TikTok. Therefore, me and Taylor Swift are best friends.”</p><p>Fellow Swifties proudly showed their support for the theory — as did Kylie. “Mathematically speaking… this maths,” she commented.</p><p>Kylie and Jason, 35, tied the knot in 2018 and have since welcomed daughters Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 2, and Bennett, 7 months. (Kylie was <a href=#>38 weeks pregnant</a> with baby No. 3 when Jason and Travis faced off against one another in the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> earlier this year.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelces-Sister-In-Law-Kylie-Kelce-Weighs-In-on-Fans-Theory-About-Taylor-Swift-inline.jpg><p>While sports fans have grown to love Jason and his brother over the years, Kylie has also become a fixture of NFL culture. Earlier this month, Kylie opened up about the realities of being married to a pro football player.</p><p>“I think there is a population of women who are married to, dating, engaged to individuals who play in the NFL or other professional sports that really, like, enjoy indulging in the finer things in life and that’s not necessarily how I was raised or what I enjoy,” she told Today in a joint interview with Jason. “So I think that staying authentic to that [is important].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelces-Sister-In-Law-Kylie-Kelce-Weighs-In-on-Fans-Theory-About-Taylor-Swift.jpg><p>Kylie and her brother-in-law have a strong bond of their own, but she <a href=#>hasn’t directly addressed</a> his relationship with Swift after the pop star was <a href=#>spotted supporting Travis</a> at multiple Kansas City Chiefs games. Jason, meanwhile, hasn’t shied away from sharing his thoughts. During the Wednesday, October 4, episode of their “New Heights” podcast, Jason and Travis <a href=#>debated whether the NFL is “overdoing it”</a> with its focus on Swift in the stadiums.</p><p>“I just think the NFL’s not used to celebrities coming to the games,” Jason said. “Basketball has it figured out. They’re all courtside, they’re sitting there. They show ’em once or twice and then they get back to the game.”</p><p>Travis agreed that the attention has been a little overwhelming but theorized that the league is “just trying to have fun” with the broadcasts.</p><p>The NFL, meanwhile, <a href=#>defended its coverage</a> in a statement on Wednesday, noting, “The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we’ve leaned into in real time, as it’s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we’ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swift has seemingly integrated herself in Travis’ inner circle as their connection continues to grow, bonding with his mom at the two Chiefs games she’s attended this season.</p><p>“Taylor is at a point in her life where she’s no longer willing to hold back,” a source exclusively revealed in the latest issue of Us Weekly. “If something feels right — <a href=#>like it does with Travis</a> — she’s jumping in with both feet. She’s very happy and loving life right now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ2jYsCqv9OeqWahnmK5osOMsJyin5ioeqq6jKilZp6Ro8BuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZquhnZ%2BnxnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mischief-night-uk-pranks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>When is Mischief Night 2020 in the UK and what kind of pranks do people pull?
