skincare item that has since gone viral and now become a morning staple for me.</p><p>After hearing about the viral success of the "Contour Cube," I had to try it myself and you would not believe the results.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/291ea32d-a726-47f7-994e-5360196f1a74.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/4e029cae-9e64-44ec-8200-5f46c9c94485.jpg><p>Sarah Forrai, the female founder of the <a href=#>Contour Cube</a>, $23, developed the product after she saw a need in the market for an ice facial product that wasn't incredibly cold to the touch and fit the natural contours of the face.</p><p>The Australian native developed her first prototype in her one-bedroom Sydney apartment with a 3D printer after growing up around her mother's facial icing routine.</p><p>Some of the benefits of long-term use of the Contour Cube are that it contours and lifts the skin, improves serum absorption, reduces inflammation, treats acne breakouts, and brightens the skin's complexion.</p><p>Within the first year of its launch, the Contour Cube has turned from a side hustle for Forrai into a successful business venture that even has celebrities like reality television star Kendall Jenner and <a href=#>Euphoria actress Sydney Sweeney</a> singing its praises.</p><p>Naturally, I had to try the product myself and see if it was worth the hype, and after one week of use every morning, I can say the results were not what I expected.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Contour Cube</a> was already popular but went even more viral after Kendall Jenner posted an Instagram story about it as a staple in her morning beauty routine, which caused Forrai to sell $25,000 worth of the product in two weeks after the post.</p><p>The product instructions are very easy to follow; all you have to do is fill the product 3/4 of the way with water and place it in the freezer.</p><p>Then, the user must remove the lid and run the ice briefly under water to slightly defrost it, and apply it directly to the face in circular motions in 30-second intervals.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in LifestylE</h2></p><p>According to the product's packaging, the cube is meant to be used "daily as an instant wake-me-up for tired skin."</p><p>Kendall Jenner used it for months, and I only used it for a week, so my personal expectations for the product were quite low.</p><p>Similar to Jenner, I have combination and slightly acne-prone skin, so I was optimistic about the results, but I wasn't expecting it to magically transform my skin overnight.</p><p>On the first day of use, I woke up around 6 a.m. to start the work day and as part of my skincare regimen, I immediately cleansed my face with a gentle face wash and let my skin air dry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/efdcce8b-6e86-405d-ab91-08dd84da66f4.jpg><p>I applied the contour cube to my freshly-washed face and it felt like a shock to the system due to how cold it was.</p><p>I didn't notice an immediate difference after the first use, but my skin felt softer and smoother after applying my serums and creams to my damp skin.</p><p>My daily morning routine came to include applying the facial icing device for about 15 seconds around the left and right side of my jaw, 15 seconds under each eye, and 15 seconds on my forehead, which I completed twice.</p><p>Every evening, I tried to keep up with my regular nighttime routine, which included a toner, hyaluronic acid, aloe serums, and a retinoid scrub three times a week.</p><p>When I woke up on day two, I did notice that my face was slightly less puffy than the day prior, and continued my morning routine with the Contour Cube.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/i-tried-kendall-jenners-contour-767092926.jpg><p>On day three, I noticed that after applying Forrai's product and doing my morning regimen, my skin texture overall felt smoother and brighter, along with my pores appearing smaller.</p><p>My makeup application seemed more seamless because the overall texture of my skin seemed more even-toned with fewer under-the-skin bumps.</p><p>That evening, I also went out for dinner with a friend and after looking at the photos we took, it appeared as if my face was even and defined and my cheeks were more lifted.</p><p>The difference really became known on day four of use, when my eyes appeared brighter in photos, and, to me, it felt like I looked a few years off of my face.</p><p>As I hit day five, I felt more comfortable wearing less makeup on my skin because I liked how it appeared to glow from the inside out.</p><p>One unexpected outcome is that, on this day, I also experienced a few breakouts on my cheeks, which I attributed to the change of seasons and falling asleep in my makeup one night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/299343a2-d6ad-4797-bf47-b13bdedb8376.jpg><p>Since the cube is advertised to treat breakouts, I took extra time on days five through seven, especially around my acne.</p><p>It was on day six that I noticed that I looked like I had fewer fine lines around my eyes and my forehead wrinkles weren't as deep-set.</p><p>At 27 years of age, I'm prone, like many others, to the bounds of time, but it appeared as if the facial icing I was doing around my eyes every morning for seven days prior seemed to have an anti-aging effect.</p><p>I am definitely keeping this as a staple in my beauty routine.</p><p>There were definitely pros to using the Contour Cube, such as I think my cheekbones were more defined after the seven-day use.</p><p>It also felt like I had a bit of Botox because in photos my skin really glowed and looked like there were fewer lines and wrinkles.</p><p>I do believe using the serum after washing my face and before using toners and serums helped with the absorption into my skin which I think increased the firmness of my skin.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Overall, my beauty review was satisfactory, and I appreciated the results of the Contour Cube, after only one week of use.</p><p>I'm looking forward to prolonged use of the beauty item and maybe I'll have the comparable skin of a supermodel or renowned actress one day.</p><img
