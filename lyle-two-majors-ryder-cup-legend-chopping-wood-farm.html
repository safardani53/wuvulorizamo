But he was at the forefront of European glory in the 1980s and 90s.</p><p>There was never anything big-time about Lyle — even down to winning at Sandwich with a hand-me-down driver.</p><p>He said: “It was one I managed to borrow off Ian Woosnam, which I put a new shaft in.</p><p>“It was an old MacGregor that Woosie had got from Eamonn Darcy!</p><p>"I don’t think either of them could hit it and driving the ball well at St George’s is hard.”</p><p><strong>BETTING SPECIAL - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS AND FREE BETS</strong></p><p>Winner of 30 titles worldwide, Lyle was also a central figure in Europe’s Ryder Cup renaissance.</p><p>A two-time winner in five appearances, he had been expected to eventually be given the honour of captaincy.</p><p>But he lost out to fellow Scot Colin Montgomerie in 2010, when his compatriot subsequently led Europe to victory at Celtic Manor in Wales.</p><p>It’s generally held that he blew his final chance on the back of two major controversies.</p><p>The first of those arose at the 2008 Open at Royal Birkdale when Lyle quit after ten holes on 11-over-par, citing poor weather conditions and numbness in his hands as his reasons for walking off.</p><p>He later claimed to also be suffering from a wrist injury.</p><p>But the damage was done and when he also became embroiled in a very public slanging match with Monty prior to The Open at Turnberry 12 months later, his dream of leading Europe virtually disappeared forever.</p><p>Lyle reopened old wounds when he effectively accused Monty of having cheated at the Indonesian Open four years earlier.</p><p>The eight-time European No1 was caught on camera replacing his ball on an incorrect spot following a rain delay, seemingly to improve his stance.</p><p>Jakartagate has continued to blight Monty’s reputation, although he later apologised for his mistake and donated his £24,000 prize-money to charity.</p><p>The duo were elected to the World Hall of Fame in 2012.</p><p>But despite winning six times on the PGA Tour, while Monty drew a blank in the States and ended up two Majors short of Lyle’s tally, he paid a high price for his frankness and honesty.</p><p>Not that he is bitter at being overlooked for the role of European captain.</p><p>He added: “It’s not something I cry about or lose sleep over.”</p><p>Lyle has no regrets either about swapping Augusta’s Magnolia Lane for rural life in Perthshire.</p><p>After years spent swinging a golf club at the top level, the 65-year-old two-time major champion is equally adept at wielding an axe.</p><p>A five-hour round of golf is like a stroll in the park compared to a hard day-long shift developing his farming skills at his Balquhidder estate 10 miles north-west of Callander.</p><p>“There is wood to be chopped and plants to be planted,” he says.</p><p>“I am also helping one of my sons on a new farm at Comrie so there’s plenty to keep me going.</p><p>“Being out in the fresh air working up a sweat gives you a good feeling and seeing various projects come to fruition is very satisfying.</p><p>“Physical work is also an ideal way of keeping fit and I have never been scared of hard graft.</p><p>“I’m also used to the alarm clock going off before it’s even light after years of early tee-times so I don’t mind that aspect either.</p><p>“There is the bonus of peace and tranquillity when you are tucked away in the countryside surrounded by spectacular scenery and I don’t have a problem with my own company.</p><p>“You have a chance to smell the coffee first thing in the morning and let your mind roam free without any distractions.</p><p>“And with so many other things going on in my life, I haven’t had a chance to miss golf too much.</p><p>“But the game was pretty good to me. I’ve had The Open Championship, The Masters and The Players.</p><p>“Winning The Masters was always a great achievement - it’s the pinnacle.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/sandy-lyle-scotland-poses-claret-745365673.jpg><p>“It’s like an athlete winning a gold medal at the Olympics and something I’ll cherish for the rest of my life.”</p><p><strong>Keep up to date with ALL the latest news and transfers at the Scottish Sun football page&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fZdxb25pX6HGrbGMra6oZZ2Wt7C%2B0mapspyVp3qkwc9mo56flaOxbq%2FHqKepoZ6ceri7zp1kn5mionw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ismael-rivera.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ismael Rivera</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alessandra-ambrosios-boyfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alessandra Ambrosios Boyfriend: Who is Alessandra Ambrosio Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
