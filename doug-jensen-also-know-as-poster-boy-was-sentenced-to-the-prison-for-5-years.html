Jensen was designated the ringleader of the disturbance, which resulted in at least 840 arrests, by D.C. federal Judge Tim Kelly.</p><p>Prosecutors charged Jensen with pursuing US Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman up the steps to the Senate chamber and attempting to “ignite a revolution.” On January 6, Doug Jensen was allegedly one of the first 10 persons to breach the Capitol.&nbsp;He was also sentenced to 36 months of supervised release upon his release from jail, as well as $2,000 in compensation for Capitol damage.&nbsp;Jensen, on the other hand, displayed no evidence of sorrow or shame throughout the hearing. His statement, or lack thereof, resulted in practically no mercy from the court. Jensen allegedly said:</p><p>“I want to be a family guy and live a regular life before becoming engaged in politics.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>In connection with the upcoming sentencing of J6 defendant Doug Jensen, who led the mob that chased Ofc Eugene Goodman up the Capitol stairs, US Capitol Police Inspector Tom Loyd filed a letter yesterday … /1 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dp9EHLZBB8</a></p><p>— Roger Parloff (@rparloff) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">December 14, 2022</a></p><p>While Judge Timothy Kelly acknowledged mitigating considerations such as Doug Jensen’s mental health and scores of complimentary letters given to the court by his family, he remained persuaded by Jensen’s own plea, according to the Des Moines Register. An assistant US attorney said during a discussion of Jensen’s actions:</p><p>“He caused Officer Goodman to retreat…[he] bet on Officer Goodman not pulling the gun.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Doug-Jensen-1.jpg alt="Doug Jensen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She praised Officer Goodman’s conduct in the face of an irate throng as “heroic.” Jensen was convicted in September of all seven offenses brought against him, including obstruction of an official procedure and assault on a police officer.</p><h2>What exactly did Doug Jensen do? Des Moines native accused of being “front and center” of Capitol riot</h2><p>A crowd of angry Donald Trump fans stormed security at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, while members of Congress were still inside. Several videos and photographs of the horrifying occurrence have subsequently circulated on the internet.&nbsp;HuffPost political writer Igor Bobic shared a video of a crowd pursuing a Capitol police officer around the complex.</p><p>Eugene Goodman, the cop in the video, can be seen trying to keep the throng away from the senate chamber before attempting to create a diversion by climbing up a nearby staircase. Bobic posted on Twitter:</p><p>“This is the terrifying moment when demonstrators first entered the building from the first level and made their way outside the Senate chamber.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Doug-Jensen-2.jpg alt="Doug Jensen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Doug Jensen of Iowa, wearing a QAnon t-shirt, was at the head of this boisterous group.
