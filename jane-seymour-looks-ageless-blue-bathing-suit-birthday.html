four husbands left her for other women</a>.</p><p>Jane divulged to&nbsp;<a href=#>People&nbsp;</a>of her previous marriages: "I was married to men who had different issues, and I never ended the marriages â€” they did, by finding other people!"</p><p>The former Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman star advised anyone going through a marriage breaking up: "The sooner you can accept it, the better for you and others.</p><p>"And then when you look out from yourself and look around to see what other people are suffering or challenged by, you realize what you have is minimal compared to other people's challenges."</p><p>The actress went on: "And so for me, I was really brought up to see what I could do for others because&nbsp;that would give me a sense of purpose. When I had a sense of purpose, I was able then to deal with what I had to deal with."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000629342611.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000629342835.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000629343325.jpg><p>Jane added the best thing for a divorcing couple to do "is to let go. To try to find a way to communicate and keep what was good in the relationship."</p><p><a href=#>Jane</a>&nbsp;was first married to director and producer, Michael Attenborough, from 1971-1973.</p><p>Her next marriage to Geoffrey Planner lasted only a year from 1977-1978.</p><p>Then Jane and actor, David Flynn, were married from 1981-1992. They share children, Sean, 35, and Katherine, 39.</p><p>Jane was last married to actor James Keach from 1993-2013, finalizing their divorce in 2015.</p><p>They share twin sons, Kristopher and John, 25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000563824661.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000268616493.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000623642511.jpg><p>Jane reflected on her four marriages sharing: "And I tried to look at my side of things: 'What could I have done differently?' But it's hard when you're a mother and you work.</p><p>"It means sometimes you're gone. And sometimes you may be in a relationship where they would rather that you were there 24/7 and never worked."</p><p>"That hasn't actually been the case with me, but that's the only thing I can look at that I did really wrong â€” I went to work. But I was providing for the whole family, so it's very hard."</p><p>She went on: "I've always done the best I could; I took my kids all over the world whenever I was working, I had them on-set with me. And I somehow managed to juggle it."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Jane has been dating producer and director, David Gree, for six years.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She told the Daily Mail in 2018: 'We had been friends first, but fell for each other over lunch one day after we had been, shall we say, released from our marriages."</p><p>Jayne went on: "We are very happy, he's the best.
