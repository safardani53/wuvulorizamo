She was ready to throw the egg into a pond (where it would become turtle food) when she heard a sound from within it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I heard a second chirp, and I realized that the chick was alive and didn’t seem to have an egg tooth to get out of its shell,” she told The Post, an observation she made after seeing a tiny, barely visible crack in the egg’s exterior.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After she “gently peeled her out of the egg,” she saw the brown, speckled bird that would become her companion for the first time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There was this wet little mess sitting in my hand,” she recalled of the moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Peanut’s mother refused to accept her, Darwin decided she would care for her. She put the newborn chick under a heat lamp and taught her to eat and drink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With a little TLC, the bird grew, but her weight peaked at around a pound, which is only one-third of the size of the farmer’s other chickens, according to The Post. The “misfit” bird's small stature is what earned her the name "Peanut" but — clearly — size is not everything.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January, at age 20, Peanut was crowned the world's oldest living chicken by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Guinness World Records</a>. She turned 21 in May.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The average chicken lives five to eight years, so it’s quite the achievement,” Darwin said of her plucky hen’s high honor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the bird does not let her newfound fame get to her head, she has always been a bit of a diva.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Peanut is a sassy little chicken — if she doesn’t get her blueberry yogurt in the morning, I definitely hear about it,” she told The Post, adding that the “healthy” and “spoiled” hen also loves grapes and bananas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the fowl also has a softer side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She’s a friendly character and she pretty much gets along with everyone, including our dogs and cats,” Darwin told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the winter, she tucks Peanut into her front jacket pocket while she completes her chores — she lives on a no-kill farm with dogs, cats and birds — and even though the hen moves very slowly now, she always comes when Darwin calls her name. She's also a cuddler.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Peanut loves to sit in my lap and watch TV,” the farmer said of the bird. “I think she just likes the warmth of snuggling up.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>&nbsp;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a>&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Peanut now lives with Darwin and her husband Bill — the hen and her 15-year-old daughter Millie have a coop in the living room — she did not always live inside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After spending her first few years in the living room, Darwin decided it was time for Peanut to move in with the coop.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Peanut (right) and her daughter Millie (left).</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Guinness World Records</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although she found a “ragtag crew to hang out with,” the tiny hen fielded a bit of harassment from the other chickens, Darwin told The Post. Over a decade and lots of chicks later, Peanut decided outdoor life was not for her anymore.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On a cold day six years ago, the chicken followed her owner onto the screen porch and refused to go back outside. “We had an old parrot cage stored there, so I put some straw and food and water in it, and that was it,” Darwin said. “She had picked her home for the winter.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For several years, Peanut refused to return to the coop — and even brought pals with her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One day she approached the screen porch with “a little line behind her,” according to Darwin. “Four other chickens also wanted in.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Chickens don’t get a lot of credit — they are really smart,” she told The Post. “They knew it was warmer there.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As time passed and Peanut got older, she decided that the hen could move inside, and she set up permanent, window-facing quarters for her and Millie in the living room. The mother-daughter hen duo still goes outside when it’s warm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Peanut's life has inspired Darwin so much that she self-published a children’s book about the hen, titled: My Girl Peanut and Me — On Love and Life From the World’s Oldest Chicken.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hopefully, there are a lot of pages left in Peanut’s underdog story. “I’m pretty fond of the old girl and I hope she sees several more birthdays,” Darwin told The Post of her feathery companion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless, the Michigan farmer hopes that fans of Peanut take something away from her life other than its record-breaking longevity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Darwin hopes “to share Peanut’s message that even if you’re rejected or might feel like a misfit, you can still find someone to bond with and have a long, productive life."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Sdsm7DzqujnWWfobGmv9NmmqGhk6Cyr3nIrGRraV2usqK%2BjKijnWWgmq6vwdNmbnJuZmh9cQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrity-wedding-dress-designer-says-pink-gold-blush-gowns-trends-2024-8416219.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tony Ward Reveals Bridal Trends and His New Collection with Kleinfeld</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tamar-braxton-has-a-new-job-thanks-to-steve-harvey.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tamar Braxton Has A New Job, Thanks To Steve Harvey</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
