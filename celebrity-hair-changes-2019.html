These 15 celebs found they could kill two birds with one stone by just getting a radically different hairstyle that transformed everything for them. Sure, it's just hair, but it's interesting to see how much someone can change with just one pixie cut. Below, a few celebs who look completely different with new hair.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Emma Stone</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>Even though Emma Stone isn't a natural redhead (she's a natural blonde, weirdly enough), it's still the color people associate her with. So when she showed up to the 30th Annual Producers Guild Awards in 2019 with a brunette asymmetrical bob, people were more than a little shocked. Not only was it a radically different hairstyle, the change in cut and color made her look like a completely different person. Eva Green, is that you?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Isla Fisher</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>Isla Fisher is another famous redhead who looks weird with any other hair color other than red. That sentiment was confirmed when she dyed her hair blonde earlier this month. "Go blonde in ‘19 or go home," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>wrote</strong></a> on Instagram. Fortunately, she changed it back to red shortly after.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Amber Rose</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>Very few women can rock a bald head, but Amber Rose has made it her trademark. The few times she has had hair, she looked unrecognizable, like the time she sported blonde wigs back in 2017. "[Wigs are] not comfortable and I’m not used to them,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>said</strong></a> back then. That probably explains why she's back to being bald — and we prefer it that way.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Alex Skarsgard</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>More than a few jaws dropped when Big Little Lies' star Alex Skarsgard showed up to an event in 2017 with a hairstyle that many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>angry men</strong></a> called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"male pattern baldness appropriation."</strong></a> Fortunately, he didn't go bald overnight and the shaved look was just for a movie role. Whew!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Lucy Liu</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>Lucy Liu has literally looked exactly the same since the 2000s, so when she dyed her hair blonde back in 2018, people lost their minds. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>her hairstylist</strong></a>, the color took nine hours to create and required four rounds of bleach to lighten her naturally dark hair.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're wondering how Lucy managed to keep all her hair and not end up walking out of the salon bald, her stylist used a special kind of bleach that didn't damage her hair.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you're using a normal bleach on Asian hair, they won't be able to do four or five rounds like Lucy did," she revealed. "If I used normal bleach, her hair would probably have ended up on the floor."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Lisa Rinna</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Lisa Rinna is another celeb who's had the same haircut for 20 years. She surprised everyone when she got rid of her trademark mom cut and rocked long hair for the first time, uh, ever. She wore the extensions for a few months back in 2018 but went back to her short hair shortly after.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Naomi Campbell</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>And hey, since we're on the subject of celebs who never change their hair, supermodel Naomi Campbell has been sporting her long, straight wigs for ages now. She switched things up last year when she attended a Paris fashion show with short, curly hair, giving fans their first glimpse of what her natural hair looked like.&nbsp;</p><p>"I do take more care of my hair now, because I lost all of it with extensions," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>told</strong></a> The Evening Standard. "I am more careful and I do different things."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Post Malone</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>Rapper Post Malone has had an interesting "glo up" within the past year. When he cut off his hair back in 2018, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>begged his fans</strong></a> to continue listening to his music. "Had 2 big a-- dreads," he explained for why he chopped his hair off. Honestly? It's an upgrade.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Constance Wu</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>When Crazy Rich Asians' Constance Wu sported pink curly hair last year, it was radically different from her usual brown lob. "I took the summer off from work. Because I knew I wasn’t going to be on camera for several months, I thought, 'I’m going to just play around,'" she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The New York Times</strong></a>. "I was pink, then I was jet black,&nbsp;then I was blond, and now I’m kind of dark blond-light brown."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Emilia Clarke</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>Most people are used to seeing Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke with long, blonde hair thanks to her role as Daenerys Targaryen. However, after wrapping up the show's final season, she cut her hair and bleached it blonde as an homage to her GOT character. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Emilia Clarke Just Cut Off All Her Hair And It's SO Short</strong></a>," Harper's Bazaar screamed after she debuted the look. Geez, can everyone calm down? It's just hair.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. Kate Hudson</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>In 2017, Kate Hudson rocked a buzz cut when she shaved her head for a role in a movie. "It's funny, too, because when (the cut) first started, I didn't think about it because it was (for) the role," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>explained</strong></a> to Jimmy Kimmel. "It was like, 'Oh, let's do this!'"&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Ansel Elgort</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>The Fault in Our Stars' Ansel Elgort debuted a bleached out 'do late last year, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Cut</strong></a> called "heartthrob hair." It definitely made him look different, that's for sure.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Salma Hayek</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>Back in 2017, Salma Hayek rocked pink hair to the Cannes Film Festival. According to her stylist, the look was achieved by dying a platinum blonde wig rose gold.&nbsp;</p><p>"I used Wella Color Touch which is a semi-permanent hair color (often used as a gloss or toner) to make a pink tone," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Allure</strong></a>. "I then added a darker cool blonde shadow at the root to make it natural-looking."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. Katie Holmes</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>When actress Katie Holmes rocked a pixie cut last year, it looked like a hairstyle that fit her personality, but the look was actually for a movie role. “We were trying to find a balance between something feminine but &nbsp;kicka-- cause she’s working really hard — her body looks incredible,” her stylist told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>People.</strong></a> "She really wanted it to move on camera so it was actually like three &nbsp;haircuts. We did it over the weekend and it kind got shorter and shorter and shorter."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. Kendra Wilkinson</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>After her divorce from Hank Baskett, Kendra Wilkinson decided to change her look post-breakup and went brunette. “Refresh button being pushed at the moment,” she tweeted. “Time for a &nbsp;change. Time to have a different outlook. Time to let go of the past and embrace new.”</p><p>Advice we can all live by.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcmZpaV9nhXCv15B6godmjp1wr8SlnJuqmanGbrTAoqlmm5iWu6ix0mZpaWlp</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lisa-lashes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Lisa Lashes net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bassem-youssef-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Bassem Youssef Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
