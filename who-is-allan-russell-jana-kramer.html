Among her concerns included long-distance and uncertainty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't know if this is my forever person," she explained on the podcast. "But, like, I'm not going to push away love just because I've been hurt before. I'm going to embrace it. I'm going to have fun."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After six-and-a-half months of dating, Russell proposed to Kramer. Then, in November 2023, the couple welcomed their first child together, a son named <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Roman James</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Russell marks the singer's first public relationship since she and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>boyfriend Ian Schinelli</a> split in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>April 2022</a>. Kramer was also previously married to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Mike Caussin</a> from May 2015 to July 2021 when they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>finalized their divorce</a>.

He played four years on the professional football club, making sixty league appearances within that period.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former Scottish athlete spent several years playing for various premiere leagues across the UK — including St. Mirren, Macclesfield Town, Mansfield Town and Airdrie — before attracting interest from Scottish Premier League teams in 2008 and ultimately signing with Kilmarnock.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When his contract expired, Russell took his international talents across the pond and signed with the American football league, the Carolina RailHawks, in July 2010. He repped the North Carolina team for one year before playing as both a defensive midfielder and a striker for California's Orange County Blues FC until 2014.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hes-currently-a-soccer-coach-in-england></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He's currently a soccer coach in England</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mike Egerton - Pool/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Russell took his soccer expertise from player to coach when he joined the England staff as a striker coach in March 2017. His work was particularly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>recognized and praised</a> after an impressive goal during the team's matchup against Panama in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In April 2022, Russell returned to his native Scotland for a brief stint with Aberdeen Football Club before taking on the role as co-head coach for Norwich City Football Club on an interim basis later that December.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-met-kramer-on-a-dating-app></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He met Kramer on a dating app</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jana Kramer/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2021, Kramer told PEOPLE that dating apps weren't for her. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"I literally hated it,"</a> she said at the time. However, the online match-making method seemed to work out for the singer because it's what led to her initial connection with Russell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although admittedly skeptical at first, Kramer revealed on her Whine Down with Jana Kramer podcast that she'd give her international connect a shot. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>"It just feels different,"</a> she on the Jan. 9 episode.

"Even with him, I said, 'No, this is silly. I'm a mom with two kids and I live in Nashville, like, how would this even work?'" she explained on her podcast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, there was "something about him" that made her say, "'Okay, well, let me just see, what does the conversation hurt, right?' This just feels different." She also shared that she and Russell were committed to seeing each other despite the distance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We're trying not to go more than three weeks without seeing each other," she said on the show.

He shared an adorable photo of him cuddling up to Kramer and their dog.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Russell paired the heartwarming photo with a simple, yet sweet caption.
