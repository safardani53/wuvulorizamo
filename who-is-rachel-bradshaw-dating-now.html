She's appearing on 'The Bradshaw Bunch' alongside dad Terry Bradshaw, her sisters, and stepmom.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Family-centric reality series' have a track record for scoring high among fans — from Keeping Up with the Kardashians to Chrisley Knows Best to Counting On. Former NFL quarterback and Hall of Famer <a href=#>Terry Bradshaw</a> is the latest athlete to secure an ensemble reality show with the members of his family, including daughters Erin and Rachel Bradshaw, stepdaughter Lacey Hester, and second wife <a href=#>Tammy Bradshaw.</a></p><p>On Season 1 of The Bradshaw Bunch, <a href=#>Rachel Bradshaw</a> is navigating singledom after breaking up with boyfriend Dustin (much to the relief of Terry).&nbsp;</p><p>While Rachel is flirting with the idea of a new romance on the show, the current update in her love life suggests something different.&nbsp;</p><p>Who is Rachel Bradshaw dating now? Keep reading for the refresher on her past marriage, her recent breakup, and to find out more about her dating life on the show.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Rachel Bradshaw dating now?</h2><p>When the show debuted in September of 2020, Rachel was in a relationship with Dustin Hughes. Before the two even got engaged, Rachel was trying on wedding dresses, and she seemed eager to take the next step.&nbsp;</p><p>"I know I'm jumping the gun a little, but Dustin and I are going to be together forever. That's what we talk about," Rachel said on the show. "So why not buy the dress first? I'm not traditional!"</p><p>But, the couple ended their relationship shortly thereafter.</p><p>Terry himself had expressed doubts about Dustin's intentions prior to the demise of their relationship, as did Rachel's sister Erin and her husband, Scott.&nbsp;</p><p>Before her relationship with Dustin, Rachel was married to former NFL placekicker Rob Bironas. The two wed in June of 2014, but Rob passed away in a drunk driving accident just three months after their nuptials.</p><p>Based on Rachel's active social media accounts, she hasn't dated anyone seriously since her breakup with Dustin (or, at least, anyone she's wanted to become Instagram official with).</p><p>But, the newly minted reality star could just be keeping her relationship status private for now, which would be understandable given the way her romance with Dustin fell apart in front of the cameras.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rachel will get back into dating on 'The Bradshaw Bunch.'</h2><p>On the Oct. 1 episode of The Bradshaw Bunch, Rachel, Lacey, and Erin visit a Marine Corps base in Washington D.C. One of the marines, a guy named Dan, develops an interest in Rachel.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Marine just texted me," Rachel tells her sisters while they ride home in the car together.&nbsp;</p><p>"You want to get over a breakup, go hang with a bunch of Marines," Rachel jokes. "They make Dustin look like a chump."</p><p>Rachel decides to wait a while before answering Dan, but he texts her again in the meantime.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>"'I'm actually going to be in D.C. tonight,'" Rachel says while reading his text. "What do I say? I don't know how to do this."</p><p>Lacey then takes her phone to answer Dan, and Rachen explains that she doesn't know how to flirt.&nbsp;</p><p>She does, however, feel a connection already to Dan. "He's got confidence, so I'm feeling it, but I'm also a little scared," she admits.</p><p>To find out if Rachel and Dan hit it off on their date, you'll have to tune in to the show.</p><p>The Bradshaw Bunch airs on Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on E!.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKuZk52yrXnBq5idq5iWxG6wwK2gp59do7y4</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-hamden-ur3v-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Hamden (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alec-torelli.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Alec Torelli net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
