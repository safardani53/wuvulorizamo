Both of them joined the squad for the 2018-19 season, but they didn’t immediately hit it off because they already had their own friends on the team.</p><p>“She didn’t talk to me,” Stewart joked to <a href=#>People</a> in 2021. “She was in Russia way before me, I came later. I was trying to figure out the team. … But then, as it went on, I [started] building the relationship with all of my teammates. And then having more of an interest in Marta, but still, you know, nervous to do anything.”</p><p>Within a year, however, things had changed. When Stewart returned home to the United States in 2019 to recover from a ruptured Achilles tendon, she and Xargay kept up a long-distance relationship — and two years later, they tied the knot.</p><p>Xargay announced her retirement from pro basketball in 2021, but she’s continued supporting Stewart as she dominates the WNBA, first as a two-time champion <a href=#>with the Seattle Storm</a> and now as a power forward with the New York Liberty.</p><p>“You and me,” Xargay wrote via Instagram in January 2023, sharing a sweet snap of her and Stewart. “It’s a forever kind of thing.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at Stewart and Xargay’s complete relationship timeline:</p><h3>2018</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WNBA-Star-Breanna-Stewart-and-Wife-Marta-Xargays-Relationship-Timeline-02.jpg><p>Stewart and Xargay met while playing for the Russian team Dynamo Kursk.</p><h3>2019</h3><p>After Stewart — known to fans as Stewie — returned to the United States to recover from an injury, she continued her relationship with Xargay via long distance.</p><h3>May 2021</h3><p>Stewart popped the question while the duo were hiking in Phoenix. “Did a thing.
