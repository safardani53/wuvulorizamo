While he was a breakout star in teen comedies like&nbsp;Superbad,&nbsp;he’s shown that he’s incredibly versatile, earning Academy Award nominations for his roles in movies like&nbsp;The Wolf of Wall Street&nbsp;and&nbsp;Moneyball.&nbsp;Still, he’s often returned to comedy with massive hits like&nbsp;21 Jump Street&nbsp;and it’s sequel, as well as offering his voice for hits like&nbsp;Sausage Party.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Over the years, Jonah, 39, has been romantically linked to a number of different women. He’s said that if it wasn’t for his career in Hollywood, he felt that he would’ve settled down at a younger age. He also admitted that he thinks he would’ve focused on family if he wasn’t an actor in a 2014 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a>.&nbsp;“I’d probably be married with kids now. It’s hard for me to focus on relationships with my job now, but otherwise I would probably have focused solely on that,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jonah made headlines when his girlfriend <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Olivia “Liv” Millar</a> </strong>was spotted with what <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>appeared to be an engagement ring</a> on her finger in new photos, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>DailyMail</a>. Neither has confirmed whether they’re engaged. However, one thing has been confirmed: <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>They became parents</a> in June 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>However, trouble was on the horizon. A month later, in July of 2023, Jonah’s ex, surfing instructor<strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sarah Brady</a></strong>, alleged via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram stories</a> that he’d been “emotionally abusive” during their year-long romance. Per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Washington Post,</a> she also publicly shared alleged text exchanges between the former couple, beginning on July 7, 2023. Along with the text screenshots, she wrote, “Someone being an emotionally abusive partner doesn’t mean they’re a terrible person (often stems from their own trauma) and at the same time it doesn’t mean it’s ok.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As of July 11, she continued to share screenshots of alleged text exchanges with her former boyfriend in ongoing Instagram stories shares.<strong> HollywoodLife</strong> has reached out to the actor’s rep, but did not receive an immediate response.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Amid the ongoing accusations, find out more about his current love, and Jonah’s past romances here.</p><h2>Olivia Millar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jonah-Hill-Girlfriends-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jonah and Liv welcomed their first child together on June 1, 2023 after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealing their pregnancy</a> in late March. Nothing else is known about the birth of their child at the time of this writing.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The pair have been seeing each other since at least September 2022, per People. Jonah and Liv were spotted at a children’s clothing store in January, but for the most part, they have kept their relationship private. While she’s dating the 21 Jump Street&nbsp;star, Liv works in fashion. She co-owns the boutique Chasseresse, which specializes in “vintage, sustainable, and regenerative brands,” according to its <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> bio.</p><h2>Sarah Brady</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jonah-Hill-Girlfriends-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Before meeting Olivia, Jonah was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romantically linked</a> to surfer&nbsp;Sarah Brady<strong>.</strong> Besides hitting the waves, which she regularly shares photos and videos from on social media, Sarah is also a law student, according to her Instagram bio. While Jonah has deleted his social media, he did occasionally share photos of himself with the surfer. The pair were even rumored to be engaged at one point, but he denied the rumors with a humorous Instagram post. “I’m engaged. But not to my girlfriend. I am engaged to your mom. I know this is shocking but please respect our privacy at this time,” he wrote, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. Neither Jonah nor Sarah officially confirmed their breakup, but in the fall, he was seen with Liv.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>But that was nowhere near the end of the story. As mentioned above, Sarah took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram stories</a> beginning July 7, 2023, to share what she claimed were “emotionally abusive” text exchanges with Jonah. In one alleged text, she claimed the actor wrote that if she expected “surfing with men, boundaryless inappropriate relationships with men, to model, to post pictures of yourself in a bathing suit, to post sexual pictures, friendships with women who are in unstable places and from your wild recent past beyond getting a lunch or coffee or something respectful, I am not the right partner for you.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Among many other things, she also wrote on July 7th that she shared the alleged screenshots as a “warning” to “all girls,” and alleged that Jonah had misused the term “boundaries” in his messages. “Someone being an emotionally abusive partner doesn’t mean they’re a terrible person (often stems from their own trauma) and at the same time it doesn’t mean it’s ok,” she continued. As of July 10, Sarah was also sharing follower reactions to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IG stories</a>, one of which labeled the alleged texts as “gaslighting.”</p><h2>Gianna Santos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jonah-Hill-Girlfriends-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>If Jonah is indeed engaged to Liv, it won’t be his first engagement.

A fellow creative, Gianna also works in the entertainment and fashion worlds in art direction, styling, and production, per her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>. Unfortunately, Jonah and Gianna’s love was not meant to be, and the pair called off their engagement after a year in October 2020, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E!

Although their relationship didn’t last, it did reportedly inspire&nbsp;Jonah’s pal&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>James Franco</a>&nbsp;</strong>to make the movie&nbsp;Why Him?&nbsp;James shared a hilarious story about Jonah being nervous early in the relationship during an “Actors on Actors” conversation with Dustin for&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>.&nbsp;“Jonah was talking to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ben Stiller</a>&nbsp;</strong>on the set one time, and he’s like, ‘I’m going to go on vacation with Dustin Hoffman. I don’t know him.’ It was really early in his relationship, and he was really nervous about it, and he thought you wouldn’t like him. He’d make a bad impression or something like that,” James explained.</p><h2>Jordan Klein</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jonah-Hill-Girlfriends-embed-8.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>As Jonah’s career was beginning, he was romantically linked with&nbsp;<strong>Jordan Klein,&nbsp;</strong>who he’d known since high school.
