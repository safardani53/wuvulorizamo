She joked that “he can feel a crumb from 2004 that was once in our bed.”</p><p>“I’d be [like], ‘I don’t know. It must be from the previous owner,’ ‘Well, there wasn’t a previous owner.’ ‘Oh,’” she laughed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapoZ%2Bjsqa%2BjLCmppmeYr%2BmsYydqa6lnaS7pXnAp5tmoKWor6K6w2ajmpyUYrOzsdCunKesnK56tLfIp6WyZZSevXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rhony-season-11-everything-we-know.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>RHONY Season 11: Everything We Know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-magid-music-producer-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Magid (Music Producer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
