The former reportedly assaulted Hernandez, who fell on his head on the road.</p><p>The man apparently suffered brain damage and died four days later at a nearby hospital. Lyle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in relation to the killing in October 2022. Lyle is a Mexican telenovela performer best known for his appearances in La Sombra Del Pasado and Yankee. According to the Associated Press, he has been jailed since his conviction in October of last year.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Hernandez’s loved ones are also in the courtroom, with one holding her face with her hand as she prays.</p><p>— Grethel Aguila (@GrethelAguila) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2023</a></p><h2>Hernández’s son requested that Pablo Lyle get the maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.</h2><p>According to ABC, Pablo Lyle risked a potential jail term of up to 15 years. Lyle’s defense claimed that he punched Hernandez in self-defense since he was with his children at the time of the incident and feared the 63-year-old was armed. Hernandez, on the other hand, was discovered without a weapon.&nbsp;Lyle’s defense team requested a new trial shortly after his October conviction, but Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez denied the motion. She claimed that security video of the event, which showed Lyle going up to Hernandez and hitting him, proved he was the major aggressor. Tinkler said,</p><p>“The evidence demonstrates that Mr. Lyle’s actions were violent. Mr. Lyle must be held accountable for his acts.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pablo-Lyle-do-1.jpg alt="Pablo Lyle do" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Juan Ricardo Hernández Jr., Hernandez’s son, wanted the court to give Lyle the maximum punishment of 15 years. He testified in court that he was there when his father died. Furthermore, the victim’s son claimed to have seen his father shortly after he was admitted to the hospital, where he died four days later.</p><p>Hernandez Junior stated:</p><p>“I refused to believe it was him.”</p><p>Mercedes Arce, the victim’s fiancée, stated:</p><p>“I know (Pablo Lyle’s) purpose was not to murder him, but anything can happen in a second. Every action has a repercussion.”</p><p>In response to the victim’s family’s plea for the maximum penalty, Tinkler said that neither side would be satisfied with her decision:</p><p>“This has been one of the most difficult decisions I’ve had to make. Nobody here will be pleased. Nobody here will forget the anguish this has caused.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pablo-Lyle-do-2.jpg alt="Pablo Lyle do" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Fox News, Pablo Lyle just apologized in a formal statement to the victim’s family for his behavior during the trial hearing, saying:</p><p>“I really apologize. I constantly pray for him and for you from the bottom of my heart.”</p><p>According to the Miami Herald, the trial was closely watched by the Latin American community.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Pablo Lyle do</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmpqcpHqtxcueZJ2nXayutHnSnqWtnZ6YsqV506hkqaqZqLyvecWoqWZtXa6yor6Mn6arZaKkrqV50ZqenmWZo7CqsMSnq2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-wolf-peter-malia-related-season-3-episode-19-recap.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Is Malias Father Season 3 Episode 19 Recap Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-ranae-shrider-the-verne-troyer-sex-tape-partner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Ranae Shrider, the Verne Troyer Sex Tape Partner</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
