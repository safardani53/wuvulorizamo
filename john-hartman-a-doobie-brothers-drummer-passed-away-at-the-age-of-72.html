Although the band issued a statement announcing Hartman’s death, they did not specify the cause or date of his death.&nbsp;During his tenure with the company, John Hartman was described as a “wild spirit, brilliant drummer, and showman,” according to the statement. The band expressed their sympathies to Hartman’s family, noting that he was an “intricate element” of the band’s identity. John Hartman co-founded the original Doobie Brothers with guitars and singers Patrick Simmons and Tom Johnston in the early 1970s. Hartman was the Doobie Brothers’ drummer for their first eight albums, beginning with their debut in 1971. Ted Templeman produced the self-titled album.</p><p>He also appeared on hit singles such as 1972’s Listen To The Music, 1973’s Long Train Runnin, and 1978’s What a Fool Believes. The third tune went on to become the band’s No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. In 2020, John Hartman will be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Doobie Brothers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/John-Hartman-1.jpg alt="John Hartman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Tributes to late Doobie Brothers drummer John Hartman stream in.</h2><p>Fans of rock & roll and the Doobie Brothers were devastated by Hartman’s passing and rushed to social media to express their grief.

Hartman met the couple while performing in Northern California Bay Area pubs.&nbsp;Hartman was born in Falls Church, Virginia on March 18, 1950. Hartman moved to San Jose in 1970 and established The Doobie Brothers. He was a member of the band until 1979 when it dissolved. The Doobie Brothers returned in 1987, following a five-year break, to play at a benefit event for the Vietnam Veterans Aid Foundation. That same year, the band reformed, and Hartman returned as a drummer. He appeared on two later reunion albums, Cycles (1989) and Brotherhood (1991). Hartman officially quit the band in 1992. Hartman was a member of the band from 1970 until 1979, and then again from 1987 to 1992.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqKCeYrWivtOmmKdlkWKxsLvBopxmmqKkwamx0axknaqlorqmvoypmKyrlZl6osPAsmSarF2ptaZ5wKCcZqeWYoRzew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-hottest-post-breakup-outfits-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashians Hottest Post-Breakup Outfits: Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessica-o-donahue.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Jessica O'Donahue net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
