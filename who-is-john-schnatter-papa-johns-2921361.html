In an interview with One America News, the far-right and Pro-Trump cable channel, Schnatter, 59, once more denied that he’s racist. Schnatter added that he believes others were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>conspiring against him</a> to get him removed from Papa John’s.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“They know he’s not a racist,” Schnatter said of himself during his March 8 OAN interview (watch below). “I used to just lay in bed and go, ‘How did they do this?’ And we’ve had three goals for the last twenty months; Get rid of this n-word in my vocabulary and dictionary, and everything else because it’s just not true. Figure out how they did this and get on with my life.” He added that he has “no history of racism,” despite his past actions. Here’s what else you should know about Schnatter:</p><h2><strong>1. He Resigned As Papa John’s CEO In 2018</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Schnatter resigned as Chairman of the Board of Papa John’s after <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Forbes</a> magazine reported that he used an offensive racial slur during a May 2018 conference call. Specifically, Schnatter said the n-word during role-playing exercise to prevent future public relations snafus. Schnatter released a statement that read “News reports attributing the use of inappropriate and hurtful language to me during a media training session regarding race are true. Regardless of the context, I apologize. Simply stated, racism has no place in our society.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>John Schnatter also heavily criticized the NFL for allowing players to take a knee during National Anthem protests and even blamed them for causing a slump in his pizza sales. The backlash was swift and heavy against his comments, which many took to be racist. He told investors in December 2018 that he was stepping down as CEO from the company he founded in 1984.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Papa John’s ex-CEO says he’s been working for the last 20 months “to get rid of this N-word in my vocabulary” (h/t <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@mount_bees</a>) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/8heITnJJxA</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>March 8, 2021</a></p><h2><strong>2. He Started Papa John’s In The Back Of His Dad’s Bar</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Schnatter sold his Chevy Camaro in 1984 to buy pizza-making supplies and began selling them to customers at his father’s Kentucky bar. He built Papa John’s into the third largest takeout and delivery pizza chain in the world that is today worth $3 billion dollars.</p><h2><strong>3. He Criticized NFL Players For Kneeling During The National Anthem</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>John infuriated many NFL fans by blaming team owners for allowing players taking a knee as a way of protesting racial injustice, claiming it cost him money and sales. He made comments to investors that “NFL leadership has hurt Papa John’s shareholders” and that the protests “should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago,” referring to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Colin Kaepernick</strong></a>, who started the movement while playing for the San Francisco 49ers. After massive backlash, he said “I sincerely apologize to anyone that thought they were divisive.”</p><h2><strong>4. He Threatened To Raise Pizza Prices If Obamacare Wasn’t Repealed</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Schnatter told investors in 2012, “If Obamacare is in fact not repealed, we will find tactics to shallow out any Obamacare costs and core strategies to pass that cost onto consumers in order to protect our shareholders’ best interests.” He claimed that to insure his employees he would need to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>raise the costs</a> of pizza and deliveries. In turn, many customers vowed to take their business elsewhere or offer to pay the extra 14 cents per pie that he claimed the ACA would cost him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/John-Schnatter-papa-johns-splash-embed-1.jpg><h2><strong>5. He Was A Donald Trump Supporter</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Schnatter donated $1000 to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. He was spotted at a campaign rally for Trump in Lexington, Kentucky <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in November 2019</a> as the 2020 race kicked off. The longtime Republican was also a top donor to 2012 Republican presidential candidate <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mitt Romney</strong></a>, 70, who held fundraisers at John’s $8 million Kentucky mansion modeled after an Italian villa that features a pool, golf course and massive grounds.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3sLTNZqqcoJ6WwbWx0WanmqiRYrewtM2sZGtxYmaAd32O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chevel-shepherd-20020618-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chevel Shepherd (Country Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-brian-howe-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Brian Howe Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
