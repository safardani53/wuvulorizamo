During part three of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Atlanta&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Season 11</a> reunion on April 21, Nene insisted that she only “pulled” a cameraman’s T-shirt for breaking her rule about entering and filming inside her closet at the party. “Well, him, but the other guy got choked up, scratched up, went to the hospital,” <strong>Porsha Williams</strong>, 37, said at the reunion, interrupting NeNe. This was news to her fellow Bravo star.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Did he go to the hospital?…I didn’t hear nothing about that,” NeNe said, surprised. Porsha continued, “He absolutely did and absolutely had scratches on his back…Choked up and head drug against the wall.” And that’s when <strong>Kandi Burruss</strong>, 42, jumped in with a new accusation:&nbsp;“His tooth got knocked out.” Porsha, <strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong>, <strong>Eva Marcille</strong> and <strong>Tanya Sam</strong> all nodded along! NeNe tried to defend herself, saying that she “heard his tooth was cracked,” but took some accountability by adding, “nonetheless, it didn’t give me the right to touch him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Eva also tried to back up her castmate. She claimed that security “grabbed NeNe” after the party host pulled on the cameraman’s T-shirt. However, Porsha’s side of the story differed — again. The new mother claimed that security only interjected after NeNe allegedly “choked the producer.” Porsha added that the producer was supposedly “making sure that every move was on him from her,” and even dived into the climatic moment NeNe faced off with Porsha and Kandi inside her closet.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>RT <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@CounselorK</a>: So now we see MORE of the footage which shows <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@NeNeLeakes</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@iheartMarlo</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@Porsha4real</a> all laughing and walking calmly out of the closet while Porsha adjusts her belt.

So at that point, I was like, ‘Okay, you know what? She means it,'” Porsha continued. At this point, she summarized her accusations: “And once I walked on out the closet, that’s when I saw the man’s shirt ripped, and then I saw her choking up the producer. And that’s exactly what happened.” Meanwhile, on the same night that Bravo aired part three of the reunion, NeNe retweeted a theory that the closet confrontation wasn’t that&nbsp;dramatic: “So now we see MORE of the footage which shows @NeNeLeakes @iheartMarlo and @Porsha4real all laughing and walking calmly out of the closet while Porsha adjusts her belt. I think editing has help create this mess.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH11e5FrZqednpp6rbHApJysZZujvKS3xJ1kqK2kYrCiucSrmKaZnmLBsLvToWScpJGeum6%2Bx6iYZqqVqruqu81mmqWno5rBcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shock-video-midnight-boy-racer-speeding-boxing-day.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shock video shows 'midnight boy racer' speeding at '180mph' on M4 during Boxing Day 'meet' as cops m</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelianne-stankus.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kelianne Stankus Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
