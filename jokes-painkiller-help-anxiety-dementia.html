researchers found that older people who regularly shared a laugh with friends and family were less likely to develop health problems compared with those who laughed alone.</p><p>Giggling with grandchildren was linked to a 38 per cent decrease in the chance of needing help with daily tasks in your seventies and eighties.</p><p>Meanwhile, chortling with your partner lowered the risk by 39 per cent and with friends it was 29 per cent.</p><p>Dr Kenji Takeuchi, who led the study, of Tohoku University in Japan, said: “It has long been thought that laughter in daily life has health benefits.</p><p>“However, most studies have focused only on the frequency of laughter in daily life, with little focus on the types of situations in which laughter occurs.”</p><p>The research tracked more than 12,500 people, aged 65 or older, for an average of six years.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health News</h2></p><p>The participants completed questionnaires on how often they laughed and whether it was alone — for example, while watching television or reading — or with other people, to identify factors associated with their wellbeing.</p><p>In a separate study, the same team of researchers found that people who chuckled regularly were 40 per cent less likely to develop conditions such as dementia, compared with those who hardly ever laughed.</p><p>To

– and reduces adrenaline, which can decrease anxiety.</p><p>Laughing is also associated with lower levels of cortisol, the body’s stress hormone.</p><p>According to some studies, it can boost the
