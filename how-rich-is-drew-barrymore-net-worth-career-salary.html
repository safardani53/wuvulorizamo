The presenters of the HGTV program bring eight celebrities to the set to surprise certain individuals in their life with a covert house remodel to express how much they appreciate their unwavering support.</p><p>According to HGTV’s press release for Celebrity IOU season 5,</p><p>“HGTV’s smash hit Celebrity IOU—an inspiration to millions of fans for its wonderful tales of gratitude and emotional home renovations—will return with eight new star-studded episodes on Monday, Nov. 14, at 9 p.m. ET/PT.”</p><p>It went on:</p><p>“The series, which drew 16.8 million people and was the number one cable show for women during its most recent run earlier this year, will include additional Hollywood A-listers who share personal experiences of great gratitude for worthy friends or mentors.”</p><p>Drew Barrymore, an American actress, producer, model, screenwriter, novelist, and voice actor, is one of the eight celebrities slated to participate in the program.</p><h2>Drew Barrymore’s net worth</h2><p>Barrymore, who has been in front of the camera since she was a youngster, is set to feature on Celebrity IOU. Her lengthy efforts in the film business, in which she has played many parts, have earned her a net worth of $125 million. The 47-year-old actor’s career began at the age of six with Steven Spielberg’s 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. When she was a toddler, she was first featured in a commercial. She appeared in Firestarter, Irreconcilable Differences, and Cat’s Eye as a youngster.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Drew-Barrymore-1.jpg alt="Drew Barrymore" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Because her parents were both important people in show business, the actress grew up in the spotlight and had a difficult upbringing. The “media darling” began abusing alcohol and drugs at an early age and had to be committed to treatment to conquer her troubles. She worked hard in her twenties to get her life back on track and to improve her reputation. She starred in Poison Ivy, which became a “cult favorite” despite a poor box office performance. Drew also appeared in the films Doppelganger, The Wedding Singer, and Never Been Kissed throughout the 1990s.</p><p>She continued to rise through the ranks and appeared in the Charlie’s Angels series, receiving one of the largest salaries of her life at $14 million. She appeared in many films, earning her Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards. While she dominated the screen with her acting abilities, the Celebrity IOU star also demonstrated her production abilities, co-founding Flower Films with Nancy Juvonen in 1995 and producing numerous films with her as the starring actress.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Drew-Barrymore-2.jpg alt="Drew Barrymore" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Drew Barrymore paid $5.5 million for a house in Montecito in 2010, which she then advertised for about $7 million and sold in 2014 for $6.35 million, followed by the sale of a Hollywood Hills property for $16.5 million in 2018. Drew then spent $5.5 million on a property in the Hamptons.&nbsp;Leslie Jordan, Cheryl Hines, Terry Crews, Wilmer Valderrama, Cindy Crawford, Kate Hudson, and Idina Menzel are among the other celebrities that have been on Celebrity IOU.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmacoprEbq7Aq6mypZ%2Bnsm66xK1ksKeiqbVur8CrnJ6qXaiura3RsmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-duggar-granted-new-court-motion-still-planning-to-appeal-ve.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Duggar Granted New Court Motion, Still Planning to Appeal Verdict</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gwen-stefani-swimsuit-shorts-july-4th-blake-shelton-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gwen Stefani Wears Swimsuit &amp;amp; Shorts For July 4th With Blake Shelton Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mamma-mia-3-christine-baranski-cher-meryl-streep.html>Christine Baranski Wants to Do a Boozy Podcast with Meryl Streep and Cher</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./n-golo-kante.html>Fame | N'Golo Kant net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tamilee-webb.html>Fame | Tamilee Webb net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./watch-jennifer-coolidge-put-her-own-twist-on-the-night-before-christmas.html>Jennifer Coolidge Reads 'The Night Before Christmas'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-cheshire.html>Oliver Cheshire- Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
